<'|'>Why vote third party<'|'>82<'|'>5bt14r<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/5bt14r/why_vote_third_party/<'|'>13<'|'>14786097980<'|'>I had posted this on Facebook and people seemed to like it, so I'll share it here as well:  If you think the country’s two major parties haven’t given us the candidates the country deserves, you’re not alone. The two parties are keeping their duopoly by producing candidates so bad they can scare potential third party voters into voting major party out of fear the other major candidate will win. Why vote third party if they can’t win you ask? Simple - the future. If a party gets 5% of the vote nationwide, they’re automatically on every ballot for the next election and given millions in federal funding to run a proper campaign. I know a lot of you are Bernie Sanders fans… he’s not a Democrat and would have been a better fit as a Green Party candidate as it much more closely aligns with his beliefs. But since not enough people voted Green last time (Democrats scared voters into voting for the candidate who would most likely stop a scary Romney presidency), Sanders had to run as a Democrat if he was to stand any chance at winning the White House, and now he’s stuck stumping for Hillary instead. Which is exactly what the Democrats and Republicans wanted. They don’t want a viable third party candidate, and they’re making sure you don’t vote third party this time to guarantee the smaller parties are stuck running placeholder candidates again next time. And then they’ll run even worse candidates so they can scare you more. Stop the cycle. Please vote third party. Our future depends on it. And this is true for all states, but especially non-swing states like New York where a vote for a major party candidate is a vote thrown away, accepting the status quo. A vote for third party is a vote for choice. It's a vote for the future.  Edit: /u/Landee09 wanted to share the post on Facebook...

While that initially sounds noble and reasonable, I must respectfully question if there isn't even more effective, more genuinely progressive work to be done elsewhere as well. Consider: self-described Independents are the largest percentage by far- it's a trend that continues to grow daily, and represents the future. Last count I heard was 42% of the population, full double digits higher than Democrats.  With respect, why on earth would we waste time trying to repair and reorganize a completely broken independent organization? One that we have to battle every step of the way for? I mean, seriously, what exactly are we fighting over? A now empty label, for nostalgic sake? Look, if these guys pull off this rigged election and successfully crown one of the two most distrusted, hated millionaires in America as president, the word "Democrat" will be worth roughly as much as the word "Republican"- a worldwide label of shame and disgust, that represents nothing of what We The People actually believe in, want, or who we are. It'll be a synonym for "establishment"... not exactly a flag we Bernie supporters would logically rally behind.  We can't rationally, responsibly, or ethically unify behind proven corruption any more. When neither party is acceptable, then that is exactly what we must choose; the people are not served nor represented by enabling the 'Democratic' party's false hope and phony liberalism, any more than Republican false fear and phony patriotism. It's time to challenge the normalized brainwashed narrative of gullibility that claims democracy means unquestioningly, religiously voting against our principles, futures, and the very founding ideas of this nation.   #JillStein #EnoughIsEnough #OligarchyEndsNow<'|'>

I doubt he will but who knows. The green party already has a lot of dedicated people but it doesn't have Bernie's name recognition. If Bernie does create his own party, is it likely the green party will merge it's people/resources? Instead of a fractured progressive movement, we could grow as one. I'd suggest Bernie just ran on the Green ticket (if he decided to run in 2020) but I don't think that would send as strong of a message.   Thoughts?<'|'>

My concern is why has the Green party been so lackadaisical about gaining supporters. It took Bernie using most of the Green party platform and the BernieOrBust movement taking off before awareness of the Green has started to rise. There seems to be a serious lack of motivation. The Green party web site has not been updated significantly in years. The Green Subreddits are low volume compared to the Bernie subreddits. There's just not a lot of activity on social media by the green party. I get tweets from Jill Stein periodically but not much else. Social media is your most powerful tool but yet not a lot happening there. I would like to see the Bernie Sanders revolution take root in the Green party if he doesn't get the nomination but that won't happen if there's not some serious up tick in activity and self promotion. The green party should have been all over the Bernie Revolution but so far only the AZGreen party has done anything significant. So what's the deal? Is the green party leadership going to be receptive to the Bernie Revolution? Is joining the green party a waste of effort? Should the Bernie Revolution form its own party?<'|'>

After this he was held in prison for thirty-one days - prior to sentencing - on NO BAIL misdemeanor charges including marijuana possession.  This brazen form of election interference kept Runningwolf from attending four out of five of the pre-scheduled mayoral debates. On September 29, Santa Rita changed his holding location at precisely the "wrong time", keeping him from attending his hearing scheduled that morning and delaying it by another four days, further hindering him from being able to participate in mayoral events.   In response, Runningwolf began a two-week long hunger strike to protest his prohibition from posting bail, the state's tactics of delay & election interference, and the injustice and oppression of the prison system more generally. Santa Rita responded to his hunger strike with another case of administrative manipulation, once again delaying his hearing.  After a month in Santa Rita penitentiary and two weeks without eating, Runningwolf was finally released and he has resumed campaigning to become mayor of Berkeley. His official statement, released for Indigenous People's day during which he was incarcerated, can be read [here](http://www.runningwolf.org/ipd.html).  From: runningwolf.org/hunger-strike.html<'|'>

I signed up as a volunteer with Jill Stein for President's webpage, as well as the Green Party webpage and the Green Party of Tennessee webpage, but I've yet to hear back from any of them.  I know that it's only been about a week, and that they surely they are pretty flooded from Bernie supporters like myself drifting in from the DNC.  Really, my biggest question is what do I do to get involved?  I want to help out, and I fear that the longer I wait the more my motivation to actually get in and work for a future I believe in will be slowly drained by the despair and hatred that currently dominates our political landscape.  So, the question is how do I help?  I'd love to be involved, I simply lack direction right now.<'|'>

I'm a huge fan of the Green party, for their economic, environmental, and democratic reform policies, but I am wary of actually voting for Green candidates because of the irrational fear of science that seems to be included in the official platform.  For example, the following passage comes from [gp.org](http://www.gp.org/what-we-believe/our-platform/17-platform/41-iv-economic-justice-and-sustainability#nanotechnology)  >Nanotechnology — the science of manipulating matter at the molecular level — is poised to provide a new industrial revolution with vast social and environmental consequences. Like nuclear science and biotechnology, nanotechnology is being pursued largely outside of public debate, risking great harm and abuse in its use and application.  >The Green Party calls for a halt to nanotechnology development until the following conditions are met:  >11. Development of full and open public debate about the implications of nanotechnology and the fusion of nanotech with biological, materials and information sciences.  >12. Development of democratic public control mechanisms to regulate the direction of nanotechnology research and development.  >13. Expanded research into the environmental and health consequences of exposure to nano-scale materials.  >14. Development of technology to contain and monitor nano-scale materials, and.  >15. Development of precautionary safety measures for the containment and control over nano-scale materials.  A *halt* to nanotechnology development until these requirements are met?  It's ludicrous, and it really doesn't seem like it's based on any rational fears.  I'm fine with increasing scrutiny on research that seems dangerous, but I'm curious why they seem to single out "nanotechnology" as particularly threatening.  My area of research is nanotechnology and I'm not aware of any particularly dangerous projects.  Some nanoparticles, like carbon nanotubes, are potentially carcinogenic (like asbestos) and are already being controlled quite strictly by OSHA, and significant research into the biological effects of these types of materials is being federally funded.  I'd be happy with increased investigation and oversight on this type of stuff, but to call for a halt to the research is quite frankly absurd.  It seems to me that the authors of this particular section are primarily worried about swarms of self-replicating nanobots destroying the world or something.  Maybe someone can give me a link to the type of dangerous nano-research that the green party is afraid of.<'|'>

And it only took four times!  American Directions Research Group. Though I wonder if that is internal polling, because it was heavily pro Dem and I believe might be a push poll because a good chunk of it was the guy reciting things I already knew about Trump and asking if it changed my opinion.  Some things were just two ways of saying the same thing, ie: "Is it more concerning that Trump will lower rich taxes or that the poor and middle class will pick up the slack from lower rich taxes?". Which sounds a bit like they were fishing for the right spin.  Nothing about Hillary being great though, like a couple other polls I got.  But dang it, I was just so pleased that for once a pollster wasn't fighting me to give an answer that was either Hillary or Trump that I was actually very nice when I said that none of it gave me many doubts about how I'm voting!  I had a headache and was already tired when I heard it was a pollster, gearing myself up for a fight.<'|'>

<'|'>The DEA is trying to ban another plant this time Kratom Call To Action<'|'>58<'|'>5cz7dz<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/5cz7dz/the_dea_is_trying_to_ban_another_plant_this_time/<'|'>13<'|'>14791662810<'|'>This time it's kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant. People have used it for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years for physical pain, fever reduction, diarrhea, coughs, hypertension, anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, and PTSD among other things. Countless people have used it to help break their opiate or alcohol addiction. Kratom has saved many lives in this way.   In lower doses it's stimulating like caffeine and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it is not an opiate. It is about as habit forming as coffee. The primary alkaloid in kratom, mitragynine, is also present in the coffee plant. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million by the AKA) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands of (possibly more than 10,000 estimated by the BEA) hard working American kratom small businesses.  The DEA tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. They cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. They later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which were undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, food allergies, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is portraying then there would be millions of dead people. They were actually going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin which is beyond absurd and frankly insane.   After the large public backlash the DEA temporarily retracted the ban. This has never happened before in the entire history of the DEA. It is historic. They are now doing a public commenting period on the Regulations.gov website (on track for the most comments ever) until December 1st while the FDA does an 8 factor analysis on kratom.  As an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada, kratom is completely legal and classified as a NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that "Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents." The Florida Department of Health added that, "there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida."   If you would like to do something about this issue then you can sign the Whitehouse.gov [petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance)(complete) and Action Network [petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/do-not-place-kratom-on-the-schedule-substance-list?source=gplus). The [American Kratom Association](http://www.americankratom.org/) and the [Botanical Education Alliance](https://www.botanical-education.org/) are raising funds to stop the ban. You may also contact your [Senators](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and ask them to sign Senator Orrin Hatch's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/SenateKratomLetterFinal.pdf) to the DEA which has 9 signatures or Senator Ron Wyden's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/9.29.16LettertoDEAonKratomEmergencySchedulingFinalSigne1.pdf) which has 3 signatures. You may also contact your [Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) and ask them to sign Representative Mark Pocan's/Matt Salmon's [letter](https://www.botanical-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DEAKratomLetter9.26.2016.pdf) to the DEA which has 51 signatures. You can also contact the White House directly [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact). There is also a kratom [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/).  If you have personal experience (not required) with kratom then I highly suggest you [leave a comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006) to the DEA on the Regulations.gov website or alternatively [here](http://kratomcomments.org/#/5/).  It would be very helpful if the mods could sticky this thread while the situation is developing. The community must stand united on issues like this. We can't allow millions more Americans who have done nothing wrong and hurt no one to be turned into criminals and become victims of the Drug War for using a natural herbal health supplement.<'|'>

I think there is real opportunity here to slingshot the Green Party onto the national stage and into the debates.  Many people on sanders4president are mentioning Jill Stein by name. <'|'>

We have to show up and support our candidate Nov. 6th and show other Americans that we are here.  Obviously our victories come at the local level for now. But it's important to show our collective numbers nationwide by supporting our candidate Stein for President.  If any of you are like me and have been playing the tug of war in your mind between voting Stein and risking a Romney win or giving in to voting Obama, let this be a reason why. We must show up to support our party and our platform of a Green New Deal. THIS is what we want, not more of the two party system. If Republicans don't win in 2012 then they'll win in 2016. And then they'll undo whatever small small steps the Democrats took on peace and the environment,  and back and forth we'll go. The truth of the matter is that while Democrats may make better strides than Republicans for peace and the environment, they don't do enough. And they do NOTHING to stop the money in politics and the two party domination - which is what prevents American from making real strides in peace and the environment. The Democrats act like they're our side but they're still *actively* maintaining the system that holds us hostage!  It's time for the Green Party to rise. We - the voters - are the ones that will make that happen by coming out for Jill Stein on Nov. 6th. And by supporting and promoting Greens at the local level at every election. Even running ourselves if there are none already!  VOTE NOV. 6!<'|'>
