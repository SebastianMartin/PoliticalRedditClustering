<'|'>Just a reminder that the US could save over half a Trillion dollars PER YEAR by implementing 3 common sense legislation pieces the rest of the world already has<'|'>471<'|'>9tpooc<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/9tpooc/just_a_reminder_that_the_us_could_save_over_half/<'|'>72<'|'>15412044920<'|'> Going by the conservative estimates (from a Koch brothers funded study, that is), transferring to a single payer health care system would save on average [$200 Billion per year](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf). Medicare for all is something virtually every other developed nation has and has better outcomes than the U.S..  Furthermore, tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy with teams of lawyers result in the loss of around [$70 Billion per year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html). Of course there will always be loopholes and even the most comprehensive legislation couldn't solve all of tax avoidance. So let's call it $50 Billion.  The final part of this trifecta is the fact the U.S. spends more on it's defense budget ($610 Billion) than the next 7 largest militaries in the world [combined](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/05/02/us-remains-top-military-spender-sipri-reports/). If you were to cut our defense spending in half, that would free up over $300 Billion AND we'd still be spending $77 Billion more than the second largest military budget, that being China's. Also it's important to note that most of the worlds largest militaries are our allies so that's an even further incentive to reallocate our tax dollars to something other than the military.  Add up all those saving and you wind up with a cool $555 Billion, PER YEAR.  That amount of money is enough to fund a Trillion dollar infrastructure bill to rebuild America over 10 years, which also includes a comprehensive 5G network all over the states ($100 Billion). That's enough to create tuition free college in the U.S. ([$75 Billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487794394/hillary-s-free-tuition-promise-what-would-it-cost-how-would-it-work)), something else the rest of the developed world has. That's enough to fully restore NASA's budget to 1% of the federal budget (an additional [$30 Billion](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)). That's enough to dive head first into complying with the Paris Climate Agreement and to combat climate change ([$150 Billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/02/fact-checking-trump-speech-paris-climate-agreement/102399674/) at the very high end even according to Trump...).  You add up all those "pie in the sky", "ultra radical" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.  Go vote this Tuesday everybody.<'|'>

Ostracized, often faced with physical abuse from inmates who view their actions as heinous and detestable, many eventually commit suicide in prison. [(source)](http://abcnews.go.com/US/prison-living-hell-pedophiles/story?id=90004)  Cue Roy Moore. Not only have many 'Alabamians' doubled-down on Moore over a Democratic candidate, but the RNC has actually reversed their initial rejection of the accused candidate, and continue to fund his campaign. While I support due process in a court of law, enough substantial evidence has been provided to reasonably question Moore's fitness for public office. If I were a Republican official (especially in the current climate of sexual harassment of the past couple months), I'd want to distance my party as far as possible from the highly plausible accusations against Moore. This Faustian deal of endorsing Moore to maintain the GOP majority and pass their haphazardly constructed legislation further proves to me that even society's worst, America's criminals, will condemn a pedophile before a "scrupulous" Republican if votes are at stake. Sexual behavior with an adolescent or younger is predatory, wrong, and illegal, whether your name is Milo Yiannopoulos, Kevin Spacey, or Judge Roy Moore. If so many Republicans have the guile to say homosexuality is immoral, but won't stand against the sexual misconduct of their peers, then when will the GOP stop being identified as the party of moral, Christian, family values?    **TL;DR**- Why is the GOP the party of moral fiber if even the people we've deemed as dangers to society have a harsher view on pedophilia than Republicans?<'|'>

He's a grown-ass man, somewhere from his late 20s to mid-40s: https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882533322160832512  Confirming he lives in Tennessee and is almost finished with his doctorate: https://i.imgur.com/gXkiLKu.jpg  Confirming he left Maryland in 1990: https://i.imgur.com/2g6MFdm.png  2) CNN didn't blackmail anyone. They did him a favor by not releasing his name. The First Amendment protects you from the government. It doesn't stop others from using their free speech to criticize your bigotry.  Racists will cry about free speech because they know their views are not accepted in public. It's not doxxing when CNN reports your name. It's journalism.  The news reports people's names all the time. Being anonymous on 4chan and reddit doesn't give you a right to remain anonymous if you're careless with your personal information and you do something newsworthy.  3) CNN also didn't doxx anyone. Again, they did him a favor by not releasing his information. CNN was perfectly within their rights and ethics to investigate this guy because he was part of a nationally-relevant news story.  The president re-tweeting something you said makes you into a person of public interest whether you like it or not, whether you posted it semi-anonymously or not.  4) He said FAR WORSE things than the GIF:  > June 2017: HanAssholeSolo posted an image of CNN journalists and employees with a Star of David next to them writing, “Something strange about CNN...can't quite put my finger on it...” [above]  > “FBI stats don’t lie n-----. You hood rats account for more that 50% of the murder, rape, robbery, and assault in the USA.”  > “I just like dancing when n------ are getting beat down by the cops.”  > “I guess letting them [Muslims] into your country and then being killed by them if you don't conform to their stone age ideology is? You can't win with these f------ wake the f--- up the only way to win is to eradicate them 100% they cannot integrate into modern society they take over like cockroaches.”  https://www.adl.org/blog/analysis-of-reddit-user-claiming-responsibility-for-president-trumps-cnn-video<'|'>

Meanwhile over at /r/The_Donald we have people who used to love Comey now calling him a liar etc. They are reaching as far as to claim things like "Comey said there isn't evidence to support *Trump's specific wording* not that there isn't wiretapping!"
