<'|'>Its time to ban rTheDonald Calling out spez and reddit admins<'|'>20667<'|'>9sf61c<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/9sf61c/its_time_to_ban_rthe_donald_calling_out_spez_and/<'|'>1099<'|'>15408339580<'|'>Currently. 674,000 Redditors are subscribed to the subreddit. Lurking in that sub is a vile, disgusting expression of hate which is simmering with violence against the LGBTQI community, Muslims, Jews and women.      From the day of it's inception (created by \[4chan as a prank to troll reddit\]([https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/09/we-actually-elected-a-meme-as-president-how-4chan-celebrated-trumps-victory/?noredirect=on&utm\_term=.9ab0eb4d13a3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/09/we-actually-elected-a-meme-as-president-how-4chan-celebrated-trumps-victory/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9ab0eb4d13a3)) ) it has been a breeding ground of hate, for racists by racists.      The Ultimate goal of T\_D was to support the election candiate Donald Trump as President, to frighten, scare and intimidate the left. Though the sideline rules of the sub reject racism, the proof is in the pudding. Any length of time lurking in that sub and you will discover it's anti-semetic and homophobic underbelly. Sadly, these comments and posts are not removed and the sub itself is riddled with calls for violence against both Jews and Muslims - Further to this it makes use to Anti-semetic memes which are disguised as something else, their use of the NPC meme further adds to the idea that Muslims and Jews and women and gays are not human while encouraging violence against them.      Their defense of alleged alcoholic rapist Kavanaugh is yet another notch in their belt of venom against the vulnerable, to attack victims of rape, and promote a rapist as some kind of moral paragon and man of the people shines a light on the kind of thinking that is rife in that sub.     We, as decent humans who stand up for whats right, we on /r/socialism and other subs which defend those who are wrongfully attacked must call on /u/spez to remove this subreddit and ban it entirely. We must put an end to a subreddit which propagates false news, hate, violence against minorities, hate against immigrants, they constantly launch attacks against poor, migrants from central and south america who are simply looking for a better life.      If /u/spez will not take a stand against hate, we need a new site admin who will. This most recent shooting has pushed things too far - it is well known that the far right wing terrorist was a regular on Pro-Trump sites.     Thank you for taking the time to read my post.      \\#DeleteTheDon  **EDIT1:** Wow I really kicked the hornets hate nest, just look at all these triggered Trumpers in the comments. RIP inbox  **EDIT2:** 4chan racists are now posting about this exact thread trying to get US banned https://ibb.co/cn1Vq  **EDIT3:** People are saying /r/The_Donald isn't being banned because of the revenue it brings reddit, so reddit is literally profiteering of the murder and misery of minorities, I think we need to go after reddits advertisers why not tweet them what you think of their support for a platform that gives a voice to neo-fascists? #DeletetheDon  **EDIT4:** /u/spez Can you at least comment to say you don't support Fascism and Neo-Nazism? because the actions of reddit say otherwise.  **EDIT5:** After I made this post, reddit admins suspended my account for 3 days. I also recieve numerous death threats, threats of violents, homophobic slurs etc etc everything you'd expect from /r/T_D racist trolls.<'|'>

Do not buy the bullshit, to anyone who is a centrist understand these are tactics used by the Alt-Right to brainwash the average person and garner sympathy DO NOT BUY IT, stay critical and think for yourself. The Alt-Right always cry about their free speech being infringed upon, they call us totalitarian - the truth is historically, they pretend to value equal rights only when it benefits them, they want rights only for themselves, they say they want to protect free speech but will show no reciprocity once they have gained uninterrupted free speech.*  *I believe it is important to be confronted with views different to your own and to think critically, however, when you abuse the right to free speech, you have pretty much forfeited that right as now you are jeopardising people's rights to safety. T\_D is not simply a place to debate certain topics, they perpetuate a culture that encourages violence - it's not right wing/Trump ideologies themselves but their culture, there is a white supremacist and hateful sentiment, Reddit has become an echo chamber for this hate.  T\_D does not allow for free speech anyway, anyone with a differing opinion is down-voted into oblivion, banned from the sub by mods or receives unfathomable hate and backlash - the users of that sub are unwilling to engage in a constructive discussion.*  The\_Donald has been inciting violence and spreading hate speech for 3 years now, there should be no tolerance of racism, islamophobia, sexism or anything of the like and yet The\_Donald is getting away with it. They are the 3rd most active subreddit and in only three years have managed to gain 700,000+ users. It has become all too easy for them to recruit impressionable/ ignorant minds into their hate movement. Now it is costing lives, with white supremacist attacks such as the recent one in Christchurch, NZ being affiliated with their agenda. Their views are deadly and their platform on Reddit is helping to spread their toxic ideology, more young people will get radicalised and commit atrocious crimes like the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting, Charlottesville, Colarado Springs - the list is long.  Right-wing terrorism makes up 92% of all "ideologically motivated homicide incidents" committed in the United States from 2007 to 2016 according  National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) - it ends now.  Posts with a Islamophobic/racist or hateful sentiment are coming out each day, they are fuelling violence;  [celebrating assault of a minor](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/b20su0/the_brain_dead_antifa_that_assaulted_senator/)  [directing attention away from mosque attack victims, inciting religious tension](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/b1qaei/to_the_leftists_of_reddit_40_christians_were/)  [demonising Muslims](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/b1qbb5/an_average_of_11_christians_are_killed_a_day/)  [denial of slavery - telling black people "get over it"](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/ap3x6q/i_never_owned_any_slaves_you_never_picked_any/)  [anti-Islam campaigns](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/awcv10/this_is_not_a_congresswoman_this_is_taqiyya_this/)  [blatant racist/sexist 'humour'](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/b101ws/top_minds_take_a_screenshot_of_a_boeing_poster/)  ["islam is evil"](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/as9497/islam_is_evil/)  [constant glorification of deadly weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/awvc3o/did_someone_say_sunday_gunday/)  [supporting underage teens using firearms](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/b21xkv/young_patriot_here_just_shot_my_first_gun/)  (evidence provided by u/american_apartheid \-thank you)  [http://archive.is/3X8PB](http://archive.is/3X8PB) \- promoted Charlottesville fascist rally which led to nazi terror attack resulting in many casualties.  [http://archive.is/YZlaz](http://archive.is/YZlaz) \- terrorist sympathy and Islamophobic rhetoric for NZ attack  Perhaps the most dangerous thing about this subreddit, they are constantly pumping out fake news and statistics:  [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/axyjkg/proof_of_border_crisis_us_border_patrol_highlight/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/b08p37/we_cant_afford_a_wall_but_we_can_afford_27000000/),[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/al04ke/proof_of_corruption/)  They are fear-mongering and spreading lies to brainwash their supporters, this is a CULT.  T\_D is cancer and goes against everything we stand for. The users of Reddit have made multiple attempts to get the attention of admins and u/ spez to no avail, we know where their loyalties lie.  We need to bring down this extremist cult, they should not be given a platform to spread their hatred.  **THERE IS STRENGTH IN OUR NUMBERS! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.**  Here is my proposal;  It is clear the admins are unwilling to do anything so we must take matters into our own hands. We must get this to the attention of big news outlets, Reddit is complicit in the spread of Alt-Right extremism by allowing subs such as T\_D to remain, Reddit is becoming a platform for extremism.  **All I ask is to take 10 minutes out of your day, send an email to the provided addresses, you can use the automated message I have written below or write your own but if enough of us do this we may be successful and expose these subreddits for what they are and also put pressure on the admins if we jeopardise the reputation of this site.**  *Email addresses for news outlets:*  1.

In recent years, Reddit has become a haven for extremism, Alt-Right extremist groups are becoming increasingly popular and have been allowed to spread hate speech without any intervention. The subreddit [The\_Donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald) is the 3rd most active subreddit with more than 700,000 users after only 3 years on the site. They regularly rally hate speech, encourage violence and can be seen celebrating the deaths of Muslims in their recent posts.  The ideology they are spreading is deadly, in the past The\_Donald has [promoted the Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' rally](http://archive.is/3X8PB)  which led to 1 death and dozens of injuries. They radicalised Lane Davis (u/Seattle4Truth)  who murdered his own father. There is an abundance of examples of [blatant racism](https://i.imgur.com/LifF3vy.png). Now they are [condoning the white supremacist terrorist attack](http://archive.is/YZlaz) in Christchurch. It is clear the subreddit is being used to fuel further right-wing extremist attacks ([evidence](https://www.reddit.com/user/areteandstuff/comments/b26v5p/compiled_list_of_t_d_spreading_hate_speech_and/)).  This must end now.  The users of Reddit have started a petition to ban this rhetoric on the site, posts such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/b1adzc/a_desperate_plea_to_the_admins_of_reddit_to_shut/) have gone viral on Reddit gaining more than 24,000 up-votes. However, the admins of Reddit and the CEO, Steve Huffman, are yet to speak or act on the issue.  Is Reddit complicit in the spread of Alt-Right terrorism and hate speech? Are these the ethos of one of the biggest platforms on the internet? And why is Reddit protecting white supremacists?  When right-wing terrorism makes up 92% of all "ideologically motivated homicide incidents" committed in the United States from 2007 to 2016, we must ask, could Reddit be playing a part in the radicalisation of people leading them to carry out attacks such as Charlottesville and therefore could it's tolerance for alt-right extremism be responsible for an increase in violent attacks against minority groups?  &#x200B;  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If anyone wants to improve my message (thank you u/TTheorem for your help editing the message), please do so in the comments. Now let's act, start sending emails!!!  Social media platforms should be held accountable, they're for profit, they too have an agenda and if it allows for the spread of bigotry then they should be exposed. I think if we, the users, raise the stakes for these platforms they will be forced to remove such dangerous rhetoric for fear of being affiliated with it.  Thank you if you choose to partake. Let's put Steve Huffman in the hot seat, we want answers.  EDIT- yes, Vox, the NY times and the Washington Post have previously posted about T\_D, however, there have been no articles written on the topic since 2017, i think it is important for this subject to resurface now especially since Trump is almost at the end of his term and tensions are rising due to alt-right terrorist attacks.  similarly, no one here is against free speech, we are against the spread of an ideology that is taking lives, RIGHT-WING EXTREMISM KILLS.  EDIT 2- wow thank you so much for all your support, i can't believe there are so many of us down for this cause, i'm proud. also thank you for all the silver and gold awards!!! This is the first time i've been gilded <3  \- there's a flood of T\_D hate coming in now, don't engage them, we don't fight hate and ignorance with more hate, just report any hateful comments.  &#x200B;<'|'>

Since i was a little kid, i heard how the dictatorship was defeated, and i never, once tought that it would maybe come back.  It will come back, like, 85% of chance it will.  &#x200B;  Now, i am afraid of walking on the street, because, starting 2019, i can get shot for being pro-LGBT, my parents can get arrested, or even tortured for being leftists. I am afraid, because i can hear for my room (literally), millions of people celebrating that our president is a fascist one.  Just as i was writing this, i heard shots from my window, from people that are now encouraged to have guns.  &#x200B;  On the last week of elections, millions of people were fighting against Bolsonaro (We almost turned the tables on this last week), now , i know that all these people that believe and fight for the same as i do, will be considered criminals. On a recent concert here in brazil, even Roger Waters was treathened with arrest for giving a anti-fascist speak (not Anti-Bolsonaro  specifically, but Anti-Fascist).  &#x200B;  But i'm not here to just complain, i am here to ask for help. I will not stop fighting, and i know that all these people will do the same, so here i ask you all for help to share this outside of Brazil, so everyone can see what is happening here, and everyone can help us. I'm not in a lot of subreddits, and i'm not in any social media (like Instagram, Facebook, etc.) so i need help sharing this to the rest of the world.  &#x200B;  And ask for help in how can i get anonymous in the internet, and fight withouth fear, i'm talking like, really anonymous. I already switched to linux, but i don't really know how to set up a VPN and these things, i need help in this, please.  &#x200B;  Sorry if my english is bad, as you probably noticed, my first language is portuguese. And if you have any doubts, i will be happy to  help you in the comments.  &#x200B;  Edit: I'm now going to bed a lot less scared, thank you all for the support, it's really nice to know that im not fighting alone, and to recieve direct suport form you guys.   Thank you all,  seriously.  Edit 2: Until now i was reading all comments, and you guys are awesome, this gave me a lot to think about, and im really happy with all the support, but im not beign able to keep up with the all comments any more, so sorry if i missed yours. If it is something really important, feel free to PM me!<'|'>

One of them moans about wanting our group to be more sociable and im always willing to go out but never get invited by him and the others never seem to want to go out. So im stuck at home pretty much throughout the week doing nothing because i never have anybody that i know who is willing to go out or spend any money. I've had enough of being bored inside quite frankly and I want to get out more and meet new people. I live in a small place called Grays in Essex and well there's not a whole lot to do here but there are some decent places to go to. I find it a bit more difficult to meet new people because ive always had a hard time fitting in with new people... Yeah im socially awkward lol but that hasn't stopped me from meeting new people before and becoming great friends with them. This question makes me sound kinda pathetic but its still a perfectly valid question, How do I meet new people? And where are the best places to do so?<'|'>

No amount of defensive rhetoric or weaponization of one group's past can justify the horrendous murders of innocent civilians and children. Despite constant agreements and peace treaties, Israel has defied international law over and over through increasing its settlements and treating Palestinians as second class citizens in their own land.  With this said, there will be absolutely ZERO tolerance of anti-semitism here. As Noam Chomsky stated, being anti-Zionist (going against Israeli state policy) is not anti-semitic and we understand the Jewish struggle with past and present discrimination. We stand with our Jewish comrades who fight against such oppressive orders, along with Palestinian brethren to end all oppressive struggles that unjust states attempt to pursue against them. <'|'>

This post is not reacting to the tragedy itself. It is reacting to the grotesque way Americans dishonor those dead by using them as martyrs to justify a police state, increase racism towards Muslims, and drum up support for the war machine that has killed uncountable amounts of people in the almost 20 years since. <'|'>

Many have already been attacked [even carving swastikas on their flesh](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6264283/Brazilian-woman-attacked-Bolsonaro-supporters-carved-SWASTIKA-stomach.html) to uphold their hate. This rhetoric is not unknown to Latin America, as we have seen countless dictators, generals, and fascistic leaders actually live up to these words; whether its Pinochet in Chile, or death squads in El Salvador.   Jair Bolsonaro is a far-right candidate who’s racism and bigotry against our queer comrades, and comrades of color is well known throughout the world. He has now vowed to purge Brazil of all left-wing political opponents if elected, including the Worker’s Party’s candidate who is facing him now. We have also suffered the lost of many progressive activists and leaders in Brazil through shady means. We may expect to lose more if he wins.  **Comrades** **in** **Brazil,** **please** **prepare** **for** **the** **worst.** **Protect** **yourselves** **while** **fighting** **to** **move** **forward.** **Have** **your** **communications** **ready** **for** **whatever** **may** **happen** **(encrypted,** **private,** **or** **other** **creative** **means);** **be** **well** **stocked;** **take** **self** **defense;** **mark** **safe** **places** **for** **you** **and** **other** **comrades;** **record** **anything/everything;** **and** **make** **known** **to** **the** **world** **what** **ungodly** **tactics** **Bolsonaro** **and** **his** **fascistic** **thugs** **put** **upon** **you** **all.** **Make** **sure** **your** **loved** **ones** **are** **as** **safe** **as** **you** **can** **make** **them,** **as** **you** **continue** **to** **advance** **humanity’s** **hope** **for** **a** **better** **future…** **Socialism.**   As for the liberals and other who stand by this “election”, be warned. Fascists always come for the socialists/Marxists/leftists first. Soon they will come for others, whether they be black, queer, Jewish, immigrants, poor, or simply people that get in their way.   Feel free to lend any support for our Brazilian comrades here. We stand with you through these dark times. Know that you are loved with all of our hearts, as we all seek to rid the world of all this hateful bigotry, racism, sexism, poverty, and oppression. The harder they fight, the more their fear is exposed. The late stages of capitalism will usher in the new stages of socialism!  SOLIDARIEDADE!  <'|'>

<'|'>Users Will Be Banned For Claiming Nazis WereAre Socialists<'|'>2084<'|'>8nege9<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/8nege9/users_will_be_banned_for_claiming_nazis_wereare/<'|'>324<'|'>15277339370<'|'>There have been many discussion/debates about the historical political ideologies of Nazism in the subreddit. The mods have been removing them and banning those users.   R/socialism (and socialists all together) takes a clear stance of not only an ideological difference, but of historical fact on Nazism:   **The** **Nazis** **were** **not** **socialists.**  The proof is not only one of simple ideological differences, but also of historical/academic backing:   > The National Socialists completely ignored socialism’s primary aim (replacing the existing class-based society with an egalitarian one in which workers owned the means of production) and substituted their own topsy-turvy agenda, Evans writes, “replacing class with race, and the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the leader”: "The “National Socialists” wanted to unite the two political camps of left and right into which, they argued, the Jews had manipulated the German nation. The basis for this was to be the idea of race. This was light years removed from the class-based ideology of socialism. Nazism was in some ways an extreme counter-ideology to socialism, borrowing much of its rhetoric in the process, from its self-image as a movement rather than a party, to its much-vaunted contempt for bourgeois convention and conservative timidity."  > German historian and National Socialism expert Joachim Fest characterizes this repurposing of socialist rhetoric as an act of “prestidigitation”: "This ideology took a leftist label chiefly for tactical reasons. It demanded, within the party and within the state, a powerful system of rule that would exercise unchallenged leadership over the “great mass of the anonymous.” And whatever premises the party may have started with, by 1930 Hitler’s party was “socialist” only to take advantage of the emotional value of the word, and a “workers’ party” in order to lure the most energetic social force. As with Hitler’s protestations of belief in tradition, in conservative values, or in Christianity, the socialist slogans were merely movable ideological props to serve as camouflage and confuse the enemy."  > The proof was in the pudding. Not long after acquiring the reins of power, the Nazis banned the Social Democratic Party and sent its leaders and other leftists identified as threats to the National Socialist program to concentration camps. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia: "In the months after Hitler took power, SA and Gestapo agents went from door to door looking for Hitler’s enemies. They arrested Socialists, Communists, trade union leaders, and others who had spoken out against the Nazi party; some were murdered. By the summer of 1933, the Nazi party was the only legal political party in Germany. Nearly all organized opposition to the regime had been eliminated. Democracy was dead in Germany."  > Above all, the Nazis were German white nationalists. What they stood for was the ascendancy of the “Aryan” race and the German nation, by any means necessary. Despite co-opting the name, some of the rhetoric, and even some of the precepts of socialism, Hitler and party did so with utter cynicism, and with vastly different goals. **The** **claim** **that** **the** **Nazis** **actually** **were** **leftists** **or** **socialists** **in** **any** **generally** **accepted** **sense** **of** **those** **terms** **flies** **in** **the** **face** **of** **historical** **reality.**  https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/09/05/were-nazis-socialists/  This is a non-debatable fact that is not only met with disgust in all socialist communities, but also considered fraudulent in most academic and historical circles. The Nazis were outright nationalists that imprisoned and killed many of our comrades before and during WWII. Nazis are consistently fighting the left in modern times.   Because of this, any comments/posts that attempt to disprove or debate this historical fact will be removed, and those users will be met with an immediate ban. If there is good-faith curiosity regarding the subject (and these sources do not convince you), please take those questions to r/socialism_101. These types of questions will be treated in the same regard, since this subreddit is a space for socialists.   **Edit:** [It seems like the lies continues...](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/8ng7w8/rsocialism_claims_nazis_were_not_socialists/)  [Read the first chapter of Michael Parenti's book "Blackshirt and reds"](https://cartiparenti.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/blackshirts-and-reds-by-michael-parenti.pdf). Also, this counter regarding Nazi economic polices:  >https://www.jstor.org/stable/27771569?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents  > Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany  > "The Great Depression spurred State ownership in Western capitalist countries. Germany was no exception; the last governments of the Weimar Republic took over firms in diverse sectors.  > Later, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in the Western capitalist countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s. Privatization in Nazi Germany was also unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public services previously provided by government. "<'|'>
