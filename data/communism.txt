Needless to say I'm rather disgusted about how the issue of trans people has basically turned people from principled revolutionaries who seek correct lines to hand wringing liberals who are worried about banning free speech alienating people:  Honestly I kinda have to say I'm a bit disappointed about how much apologism people are having for the CPGB-ML's line. Its a big reason why a lot of trans people don't trust ML's much as when horrifically backwards reactionary lines get spun, there comes in a wave of sudden apologism and justifications.  The r/Communism page was pretty much spammed with transphobic garbage by merely saying trans people belong. There's been a huge amount of long term members on here saying shit like "Trans people are anti-materialism" or "Trans women are men stfu about LGBTWTFGARBAGE". There's a serious issue in this community with trans-antagonism and honest to god a lot of the responses have been piss poor.  Why the fuck would CPGB-ML change their line when people are offering such limp wristed criticism. Trans people are one of the most marginal groups in society but the actual response to defending them has been piss poor. People are more mad at people who criticise Stalin or Mao then they are about the systematic attacks and repression of trans people in our society. Its fucking sick, I'm sick of LARPers who are more interested and passionate about debates in history about which past figure is the best or defending states that no longer exist over actually defending the marginal masses when they're under aggressive attack by 5th columnists in the movement.  Its frustrating. A lot of you are acting like Trots with rape allegations; excuses, apologism and downplaying. Just fucking take a stance to defend trans people, who fucking cares if they're fellow ML bros. What the fuck even is the point of saying you're pro trans when you all do diddly dick when your buddies call trans women men  This movement has a transphobia problem, its epidemic. If people were going around saying MRA lines and racist white supremaicist lines you'd know thats unacceptable. Now apply that same analysis to the current issue of transantagonism within these groups. It is not fucking hard. We don't need 'race realists' in the movement, we don't need incels or MGTOW's in the movement. If these people identify as Marxist to try and pollute the movement a push back would be needed to protect POC and women comrades. Where's the standing up for trans folks. CPGB-ML's stance is on par with the fucking Tories. That's a absolute national disgrace  Done with this rant, I'm sick of the liberal free speech hand wringing, y'all should know better  EDIT: Also to people who claim "But a lot of people are reactionary" the CPGB-ML is a PARTY, part of having a party is you're meant to advance people's line. If your party is actively degrading people's lines on important issues, the party might as well be Strasserite for all its worth. CPGB-ML aint even that large and their leadership has flipped off virtually every attempt to reform their line. Sometimes a abusive relationship has to be left, and CPGB-ML is one of those times.  EDITEDIT: Also educating is a two way street. If transphobes are just coming here to sealion or spout slurs with no intentions of changing their minds, you’re not educating them, you’re giving them a platform  EDITEDITEDIT: Yes I know some older folks have backwards lines on this issue. Being older doesn't excuse that. I'm sure there was a lot of older Marxists back in the 1930's that thought Unions should be for the white man. If people like Corbyn or god forbid even Sanders can hold a half way decent line on trans folks despite being incredibly old, then there's no excuse for older members of Communist parties. Are we saying that the older Communists are more reactionary than the older Social Democrats? I think that's selling old Communists short.<'|'>

<'|'>In 1982 the CIA admitted that the Soviet Union was ‘basically selfsufficient with respect to food’<'|'>760<'|'>9yghkz<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/9yghkz/in_1982_the_cia_admitted_that_the_soviet_union/<'|'>47<'|'>15426319370<'|'>Quoting the 1982 report, featured in [page 431 of this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=63_obglArrMC&pg=PA431):  >‘In 1981, grain imports and other agricultural products reached almost $12 billion, or about 40% of the U.S.S.R.’s total hard currency purchases. Despite the large‐scale expansion in agricultural imports though, **the Soviet Union remains basically self‐sufficient with respect to food. These imports are intended primarily to prevent a decline in meat consumption and are not essential to maintaining an adequate quantity of food consumption.** At 3,300 calories, average daily food intake equals that in developed Western countries. **Grain production is more than sufficient to meet consumer demand for bread and other cereal products.** To summarize, when we say that the U.S.S.R. is self‐sufficient, we do not mean that the Soviets neither need nor benefit from trade. Imports, particularly from the West, can play an important rôle in relieving critical deficiencies, spurring technologic progress, and generally improving Soviet economic performance. What we mean is that **the Soviet economy’s ability to remain viable in the absence of imports is much greater than that of most, possibly all, other industrialized economies.** Consequently the susceptibility of the Soviet Union to economic leverage tends to be limited.’  Imports were essentially supplementary; demanded more so for optimization than for emergencies. Nonetheless, it raises the question: why have food imports at all?  The agency glosses over this issue with the excuse that central planning and administration by fiat apply poorly to agriculture. However, there is one factor that they don’t discuss: the environment. Quoting pages 18–19 from [*Soviet Agriculture*](https://ia801202.us.archive.org/12/items/SovietAgricultureMorozov/SovietAgricultureMorozov.pdf):  >‘The natural and climatic conditions of the U.S.S.R.’s agriculture are both severe and unstable. No other major country faces such serious problems in overcoming their negative influence on agricultural production. Agroclimatologists estimate that on the average these conditions are 2–2.5 times worse than in the U.S.A. […] Generally over 60% of the country’s territory is periodically subjected to droughts and other unfavourable weather influences. At the same time that zone normally accounts for approximately 75% of grain deliveries. The year 1972 for example featured a snowless winter that destroyed the crops of 12 million hectares of sown land, then drought affected more than 100 million hectares of arable land. This is a very large area; almost twice the size of France. […] The drought in 1975 however was even more severe. In fact, Soviet farmers had never yet experienced such unfavourable conditions. More generally the frequency of droughts between 1963 and 1975 is matched only by that of the 1890s (when a series of harvest failures shook Russia).’  However (quoting pages 19–20):  >‘The country’s average yield per hectare of land was 8.3 centners in 1963, 9.5 centners in 1965, 12.1 centners in 1967, 14 centners in 1972, and 13.8 centners in 1975. The gross grain harvests in the corresponding years were 107.5 million tons, 121.1 million tons, 147.9 million tons, 168.2 million tons, and 140 million tons [a drought year, remember] respectively. […] In a sense, difficult years were a sort of test for our social system’s foundations, but they only show that the Soviet path of agricultural development and the agrarian policy […] which serves the needs of a comprehensive consolidation of collective and state farms, have been bearing fruit. In the U.S.S.R. the socio‐economic conditions governing the agricultural development are gradually reducing its dependence on spontaneous fluctuations in the weather as well as the work conditions’ harshness on the land.’<'|'>

I hope that none of you will be in danger, and that no one you know and care about is in danger.  **PRACTICAL** **THINGS** **TO** **DO** **RIGHT** **OW**  1: get a VPN that has servers that the brazilian government can't subpoena. delete your social media accounts that you've used that have leftist and pro PT stuff on them. Make sure that going forward nothing is traceable to you. Any new media accounts you have that are political must be tied to a dummy email account.  2: if you have the means, keep a stash of money in a very safe place that's hidden but accessible. If the worst happens and you ever have to leave the country, you'll need bribe money. You'll need documents and authoritarian regimes don't always make it easy for certain people to get them. also keep a few gold rings hidden too. They're valuable everywhere you might end up.  3: get a passport now. get all those documents now. even if you don't plan to leave, get them right fucking now so you can be processed elsewhere and you'll be let on a flight if you need to go before the option might vanish. Keep copies in a bank box if your country's banks are reliable. Keep digital scans in an encrypted thumb drive. The digital scans can be used to get real copies at a brazilian embassy or consulate if your government is willing to still provide them to you.  4: if you take medication, keep careful track of your prescriptions. Always make sure that you have a 2 month supply that you can take with you. You might not be able to get the exact same meds in another country due to differences in regulatory approval for certain active ingredients and their approved applications, and it might take time to get a replacement drug in a host country.  **MENTAL** **HEALTH**  You're scared and angry. Maybe not necessarily for yourself even, but for others. That's good. That means you're still sane. That also means you're feeling a lot of alienation because you're surrounded by people who see nothing wrong with what is going on around you. It will get worse. That feeling will grow and fester. If you have empathy, you can never turn it off completely. You will feel like a stranger in your own country until this is over. Already you and people you care about have been demonized. Loan wolves, groups, and the state may all act on that demonization. Right now you may not even be sure what you can do and if you should even try to do anything. That's normal. But you have until January to decide what you do, and if you become a private person to try to protect your own safety, or if you decide to stay and become a public person to help others and yourself. If you can't be brave, then be kind. If you can't put yourself out there, and I'm not saying you should, then do what you can quietly until you can't bare it anymore and you have to leave. But until you decide how you're going to respond, you will feel alienated. If you ever feel numb, then you're loosing your humanity. You're going to have find a confidant. Maybe it's your spouse, maybe it's someone else in your life like your best friend. very few people can bare the emotional burden you will feel when it all kicks off and never say anything. You will need to talk to people, and you need to know they won't betray you if it gets extremely extremely bad. You will also feel anger. That's also normal. But quash it if you can. Anger can make you do reckless things. You will get your revenge by living and not conceding to the madness around you. You need to be smart. Assume that lists of names are being assembled. You can no longer speak out so openly. Make sure you know who you're talking to and who's listening.     Take care. No matter how bad it gets, remember that there are people who care deeply about you. You're never as alone as you might think you are. I've been asked in DMs about VPNs. Here's a great article that explains a lot about the pros and cons of some reputable major ones out there. I personally recommend NordVPN "  ~ Via /u/adlerchen  Tips from other users:  -If you have a Portuguese grandparent, you are eligible for citizenship. via /u/AimingWineSnailz  -In regards to VPNs I would recommend Mullvad over NordVPN. One indicator that might be a good idea is that NordVPN does this (taken from OP's article):  > We use Google Analytics and third-party ticket/live chat tools (Zendesk/Zopim). Google Analytics is used to improve our website and provide our users with the most relevant information. The ticket/live chat tool is used to provide the best support in the industry (available 24/7), but not tracking our users by any means. I mean, they don't even bother with shielding their users from fucking Google...  Mullvad meanwhile:  > We have no external elements at all on our website. We do use an external email provider; for those who want to email us, we encourage them to use PGP encryption which is the only effective way to keep email somewhat private. The decrypted content is only available to us. Way better. That's not to say that NordVPN isn't decent a choice though!  If you can't afford a VPN subscription and need a free VPN go with ProtonVPN.  Also mail! Please change to something like either tutanota or protonmail.   ~ Via /u/Sartanen  -**Recommended** **email** **providers:**  [Tutanota](https://tutanota.de/)  [Riseup](https://riseup.net/)  [Protonmail](https://protonmail.ch/)  **Regarding** **VPNs:**  The VPNs you will purchase most likely offers non-Brazil locations. Use them, not the ones located in Brazil. Can't afford a VPN? Use [Tor](https://torproject.org/). Can afford a VPN? Use Tor still. Most of these services are available with a dedicated .onion address which are more secure than the clearnet one.  **Secure** **payments**  Avoid using credit cards/bank accounts/etc for purchasing a VPN or other things you prefer to keep discreet whenever possible. Get Bitcoin or other currencies instead. Simply buying bitcoin from someone is usually enough, however for extra security you can tumble the coins using [Privcoin](https://privcoin.io/) or other coin mixers.  Check out [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) for more tools and tips for security.  https://0bin.net/paste/2oF2qNpVf8mNFqu8#B-iER4pDBL8qgc+iiUc9klwrcazlgK1bxPMMlASeOXx link to reddit post source code  ~ Via /u/Codefuser<'|'>

My father brought a story from my grandmother about my Great Great Uncle Munya.   Munya was a Russian Jew at the time of the Russian Revolution, and was arrested by the tzar’s police one day. He was a Bolshevik Revolutionary who got arrested for armed robbery of a mail train. Eventually he was let out of prison and sailed over to America where my family is now.  tldr: my great great uncle was a communist revolutionary who robbed a train.  I have never been more proud of my heritage.<'|'>

This atop the fact that people are using completely different definitions of socialism, even in leftist circles, and throw around words like authoritarian- something which defines every government on the planet, to differing levels. I'm just so tired. I turned to MLism about a year ago and have found the reading so enlightening, but I can't even get members of my family to read any of it (it doesn't help that two of them are polysci majors that went to schools in the Midwest where they learned the bourgeois histories). How do you keep fighting? I've been wanting to join an organization, but if I can't even convince my family of these ideas I don't know what help I'd be. I'm just feeling down. How do you keep your optimism?<'|'>

One of the problems I've seen on other leftist subs is a lot of "Hey, any comrades in _____" posts that get buried or only last for a day and are gone and then never seen. Some subs had posts right after the election, but since then, it seems as if there haven't been any other attempts to organize IRL. Our local group in Las Vegas formed after one of those posts, but we of course need more people organizing ASAP. I think if we're not organizing, we're dying. This is something we need to start doing immediately. What are your thoughts?

What I do want to say is this city is a hotbed of white supremacy and neo-conservatism. As a communist (ML) who firmly believes in direct action, how does one organise in a climate such as this? The local socialist society is, shall we say, limpwristed at the best of times. This has most certainly affirmed those of a pure heart and spirit, but they go no further. This has left me feeling utterly helpless and I'd really like to seek advice on anything I can do when I'm almost certain I'm the only one in this opinion in this whole city. I'd especially love to hear from people  who have had a similar experience in feeling isolated in their views.<'|'>

Now America is, for the world, nothing more than the United States: we inhabit at best a sub-America, a second-class America, of nebulous identification. It is Latin America, the region of open veins. From the discovery to the present day, everything has turned into European capital or, later, North American capital, and as such has accumulated and accumulated until today in the distant centers of power."  imperialism acts in various ways, and one of them is undoubtedly cultural domination. this also includes the name-hijacking that has happened since the US became an industrial power. you see, up until the mid 1800's, North America was similar in many ways to its southern counterpart. but something happened along the way, maybe something to do with rapid industrialization and 2 World Wars. the fact is, by the 50's, the global hegemonic power on the Western Bloc was undoubtedly the US.  well, with economic hegemony comes cultural hegemony. [Europe also partly fell victim to this](https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/The-war-years-and-post-World-War-II-trends), as some international contracts were signed post-WW2 that forced Europe to open its markets to the Hollywood movie industry.  Europe, however, despite being partially culturally dominated, was never economically dominated, therefore never fully dominated. full domination is always more debilitating and humiliating. it's perhaps this double domination that helps the Third World remain "the Third World". it's the old "Mungrel Complex", as was coined by Nelson Rodrigues.  stigmas have real cultural and therefore material impacts, and the stigma of a secondary continent that has been attributed to our exploited part of the world is no exception. there is a growing culture of US worship in most Latin American nations today. no wonder why Brazil just elected a full-on bootlicker who's in a position of complete [submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-_P6K8YXU) [to](https://br.sputniknews.com/brasil/2019031813516421-bolsonaro-base-alcantara/) [US](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/bolsonaro-isenta-cidadaos-de-eua-australia-canada-e-japao-de-visto-para-o-brasil.shtml) [interests](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/18/bolsonaro-trump-meeting/). *(each word is a link to a different humiliating news article, try it! most are in portuguese though, unfortunately)*.  neglecting the power of symbolism in discourse here is no short of undialectic and reactionary. if we want to free all peoples from exploitation, then we might as well do it on a cultural level. no country will truly be free from US imperialism if they aren't economically independent.  all exploited continents must somehow manage to eliminate the submissive aspect that was injected into their culture through centuries of imperialism. i'm just not African or Asian or Middle-Eastern to know precisely what measures should be taken to grant cultural independence based on the conditions there. but I can speak as a Latin American. if we keep referring to the US as "normal America", Latin America will always be "that other one".  my point here is: as long as we, comrades with the intention of liberating every working person in this world and establishing full-on Communism, it's our obligation to also free all peoples from long overdue stigmas of subservience. subservience will always lead to the sabotage of our sovereignty and of our own culture.  after all, we can't expect the exploited parts of the world to ever get over their past exploitation if they still retain the mindset of a slave.  and lastly, because it sounds ignorant as fuck. it's like calling the USSR "Communist Russia" just because Russia was the predominant SSR in various aspects.   anyway thanks for reading my piece of thought. english is not my mother tongue, so there's that. last time I posted this on r/TrueOffMyChest i was downvoted into oblivion and so i thought this sub may be more appropriate.<'|'>

I'd been aware of the show for quite a while but hadn't paid it much attention. When I saw the level of interest that /r/communism showed, I figured I would contact the minds behind the programme to let them know.  So, yesterday I met with Zhang Guozuo, the director of the Chinese Cultural Soft Power Research Center and Dean of the School of Marxism at Hunan University, and put two requests to him:  1. Please translate the two seasons of this show into English 2. Please consider a new episode/season about the struggles of Communists outside of China  Professor Zhang told me that he thinks these are both excellent ideas. He will contact the production staff at Hunan Television and encourage them to produce English subtitles. He also said that he is eager to develop a plan for a third season where foreign Communists will be interviewed.  If comrades have any ideas for a possible third season, or wish to recommend possible guests to appear, please comment in this thread. I will share these suggestions with Professor Zhang next time I see him.  &#x200B;  Edit: “Talk shows” not "talks hows"  Further Edit: I'm pretty new to Reddit but I think one is supposed to say thank you for gold. So, thank you kind stranger! At the moment, English subtitles haven't been confirmed so I don't know where they will be made available. However, I will keep in touch with Professor Zhang and report back when I have something concrete. What I really hoped to do with this post was two fold:  1. Collect good ideas from comrades around the world that I can present to Professor Zhang for a potential third season. The more and better ideas we have for him, the more likely I think he is to act on his word. He is an extremely busy person with a lot of projects on the go, so if we can present something well formed he is much more likely to use it.  2. Encourage comrades to take chances and reach out to others with ideas, projects or whatever.   Thank you to everyone below who has contributed suggestions!  &#x200B;  &#x200B;<'|'>

He had been left alone for scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his armchair, peacefully gone to sleep -- but for ever.  An immeasurable loss has been sustained both by the militant proletariat of Europe and America, and by historical science, in the death of this man. The gap that has been left by the departure of this mighty spirit will soon enough make itself felt.  Just as Darwin discovered the law of development or organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.  But that is not all. Marx also discovered the special law of motion governing the present-day capitalist mode of production, and the bourgeois society that this mode of production has created. The discovery of surplus value suddenly threw light on the problem, in trying to solve which all previous investigations, of both bourgeois economists and socialist critics, had been groping in the dark.  Two such discoveries would be enough for one lifetime. Happy the man to whom it is granted to make even one such discovery. But in every single field which Marx investigated -- and he investigated very many fields, none of them superficially -- in every field, even in that of mathematics, he made independent discoveries.  Such was the man of science. But this was not even half the man. Science was for Marx a historically dynamic, revolutionary force. However great the joy with which he welcomed a new discovery in some theoretical science whose practical application perhaps it was as yet quite impossible to envisage, he experienced quite another kind of joy when the discovery involved immediate revolutionary changes in industry, and in historical development in general. For example, he followed closely the development of the discoveries made in the field of electricity and recently those of Marcel Deprez.  For Marx was before all else a revolutionist. His real mission in life was to contribute, in one way or another, to the overthrow of capitalist society and of the state institutions which it had brought into being, to contribute to the liberation of the modern proletariat, which he was the first to make conscious of its own position and its needs, conscious of the conditions of its emancipation. Fighting was his element. And he fought with a passion, a tenacity and a success such as few could rival. His work on the first Rheinische Zeitung (1842), the Paris Vorwarts (1844), the Deutsche Brusseler Zeitung (1847), the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (1848-49), the New York Tribune (1852-61), and, in addition to these, a host of militant pamphlets, work in organisations in Paris, Brussels and London, and finally, crowning all, the formation of the great International Working Men's Association -- this was indeed an achievement of which its founder might well have been proud even if he had done nothing else.  And, consequently, Marx was the best hated and most calumniated man of his time. Governments, both absolutist and republican, deported him from their territories. Bourgeois, whether conservative or ultra-democratic, vied with one another in heaping slanders upon him. All this he brushed aside as though it were a cobweb, ignoring it, answering only when extreme necessity compelled him. And he died beloved, revered and mourned by millions of revolutionary fellow workers -- from the mines of Siberia to California, in all parts of Europe and America -- and I make bold to say that, though he may have had many opponents, he had hardly one personal enemy.  His name will endure through the ages, and so also will his work."  [Frederick Engels’ Speech at the Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery, London.

The "liberal" Democrats are the most classist assholes I have ever seen. The way they talk about "hicks" for example, the poor in the south. They pride themselves on being "tolerate" but they show almost racial distaste for the impoverished people living in the south. The people in the south are racist because that's how the Republican branch of capitalist keeps them in check, when they blame minorities for all their problems, it's because they how been brainwashed to do. Bigotry is the bourgeois trick these people into being on their side. The politicians also use superstitious fear to manipulate them. They don't understand that it is the people and system they support that causes their suffering. I believe that the "hicks" have much more revolutionary potential than the petty bourgeois Democrats, if we could reach them<'|'>

He's winning easily, because Peterson is so poorly educated on these subjects, that most of the content of this debate is just Zizek correcting the horrible assumptions of Peterson, but has included Zizek shitting on basically every communist and national liberation movement out there.  This ended up being Peterson shoots himself in the head while Zizek explains to the audience how bullets work, except in debate form.  What a waste.<'|'>

Nationalism and religious fanaticism has been on a  rise in Georgia since the Soviet Union fell. Recently biggoted religious laws have been proposed, like the law that would force priests outside the orthodox church to serve in the army. Also, one of the most prominent leaders of our parliament said in a recent speech that : " there is no place in Georgia for young Communists". He also said that we (the young Communists) are on a wrong path and that it would be better for us to abandon that path. Sound like a threat if you ask me. Another terrible thing that is happening is that it is a political suicide for a Georgian political party to disagree with anything that the church says. What do you think that far left wingers (who are a very small minority to begin with) should do to combat this situation? No one really takes us seriously or likes us, so protest wouldn't work.

He still believes that a man should suffer in this Life to get into heaven in the afterlife.  He blames it all on the Apple that Adam and Eve ate for the condition of humans today.  Well it's a struggle i am taking and am willing to take, the results are abundant and we have managed to gain a lot of student members in our organisation, I believe we are very close as we are starting to have an impact in the politics here, however we are working in a secretive manner in the shadows so as to avoid persecution and intervention by the government.  Viva le révolution comrades, Greetings from Purple phoenix.  Hope we are able to unite and work together  Edit: I want to boast about this, it took me a year to organise and start working with the male division of our group , while just a few weeks ago I managed to appoint a women leader and open the women branch, they managed to organise and start working within a week not only that the entire branch is more thorough in their theory then i have managed to make the men wing, i do not understand why women are considered inferior, they are doing better than any standards and have already grown to a hundred members. And have managed to start working with an anti-trafficking organisation something which the male wing was struggling to get in  And thank you for all the support it will greatly encourage us and help us to push on, the past few weeks have been the most hard for me as an individual, after all I am still a kid in a big scary world.<'|'>

I read this article by Scott Thomas that basically explains why I favor communism to core capitalism any day.  Here is a portion of his article that belongs to him.   “Sometimes anti-Autistic propaganda is set forth by groups that purport to assist people. For example, the charity Autism Speaks promotes the Tragedy Model of Autism, which is the idea that a diagnosis of autism means certain, unbearable, financial and emotional hardship for the family of the Autistic. A promotional video called "Autism Every Day" includes former executive vice president of Autism Speaks, Alison Tepper Singer, voicing her fantasy to drive her daughter and herself off of the George Washington Bridge. The organization stated that non-Autistic parents of Autistics should embrace these types of feelings rather than flee from them or seek help for them. This propaganda creates an attitude of dehumanization; the message is that we are so devastating to abled peoples' lives that we should be eradicated via whatever means necessary (whether by cure or another method), and that our lives are so miserable they must not be worth living. Sometimes, tragically, this occurs, like the 2006 case of Katie McCarron, a three-year-old Autistic girl in Illinois whose mother was convicted of first-degree murder for suffocating her. People who kill Autistic and other people with disabilities are more likely to be acquitted by sympathetic juries or more lightly sentenced by judges than those who murder non-disabled people. (thiswayoflife.org)   Socialism, disabilities and the 99%   The dehumanization of Autistics and people with other disabilities stems from a fundamental element of the capitalist system. Under capitalism, all things that exist are valued according to their ability to generate profit for the 1%. Even the 99%, who have nothing to sell but their labor, are given value according to their ability to produce profit for the 1%, who make money purely via their ownership of the means of production.   Because of this, those in the 99% are valued according to their ability to work within the profit-producing machine that the 1% engineered. Therefore, the 1% want to give us as little as possible; they attack us with institutionalization, poor education and austerity measures. Because of this devaluation, people with disabilities have been neglected, abused and killed since the dawn of class society.   Despite the many transgressions which capitalist society has carried out against Autistics and other people with disabilities, there is still hope for the future. In Cuba, a country where the 99% rose up and drove out the 1%, people with disabilities are viewed, first and foremost, as people who have something to contribute to society, rather than a burden. Rather than cut away at education, health care and benefits, as is happening in the U.S. and other capitalist countries, Cuban society provides excellent education free through the university level, free health care, and jobs or income for all.   Cuban schools use a diverse set of educational approaches geared toward helping Autistic children become educated and happy citizens capable of making a contribution to socialist society, rather than being trained to become cogs in the profit machine as in the U.S. People with disabilities who are unable to do the work that most Cubans do are given jobs reading to other workers so that the workers are better able to enjoy the time spent at work. These jobs provide people with disabilities both the income to support themselves and the satisfaction that comes with knowing that one is valuable to society.   Capitalism offers only dehumanization, destitution and even death to people with disabilities. Only by smashing the 1% can people with disabilities have the full freedom to live the most fulfilling lives possible, unhindered by the misdeeds of a system that seeks to destroy us.”   And I am new here and I hope to make allies.    <'|'>

Nowhere is the pain of injustice and capitalist corruption more obvious the continent of Africa. Our comrades in Africa have endured the worst of imperialism's evil.   The simplest freedom from oppression is world communism, beginning with a global revolution. In Africa, all the ingredients of a communist revolution are in place; ample weaponry, guerrilla environment, and many sympathizers of socialism/communism.  The great continent of Africa has more than a billion people, more than a billion comrades waiting to be freed of the injustice of capitalism. Many problems of the 21st century, such as climate change and disease, have been directly addressed under communist states such as that of Sankara's.   Comrades, if we wish to see a day where the working class is free from the tyranny of the bourgeoisie, we must begin an African revolution that will tell all: "Proletarians of the world, unite!"<'|'>

The Command of the First Belorussian Front allotted the necessary [victuals](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/victual#Noun) out of its reserve stocks and detailed to deliver them two army motor transport regiments totalling some 2,000 vehicles, some of which were placed at the Berlin municipality’s disposition. The military commandants’ offices were given 386 supply officers to organise warehouses and restore the most important food industry installations such as flour mills, macaroni factories and abattoirs.  >**The Soviet Government sent to Berlin 96,000 tons of grain, 60,000 tons of potatoes, up to 50,000 head of cattle for meat, sugar, fats and other products.** By May 18 ration cards were distributed and the Berliners began to draw their food on them.’  [Photographic example.](https://redd.it/avpnnv)  (Supporting citation: [Grigori Deborin, *Вторая мировая война*, pgs. 340–343.](http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/D/DEBORIN_Grigoriy_Abramovich/_Deborin_G.A..html#002))<'|'>

Every page of this newspaper had something like "socialists take power in Kaiserless Germany" or "councils take control of factories in X Y Z German cities." There was even an entire article about how the Bolsheviks were allowing for women to go to universities, abolishing tuition, and investing huge amounts in public education. My classmates know I'm a communist, and it was a delight to see all of this stuff about the socialists in this old newspaper. Believe it or not, the coverage I saw was relatively positive, or at least not horridly negative. <'|'>

This is a collection of books covering a wide range of topics: Soviet socialism and its achievements, the crimes of US imperialism, and much more.   One topic that's covered in these books (*Managing Dissent* and the series of articles by *Cats, Not War*) which I feel doesn't get as much attention as it should is "soft" imperialism: NGOs with connections to the US state department, that market themselves as "humanitarian". These NGOs operate in the "civilian political-legal space" of target countries which are unfriendly to US economic desires. They can be thought of as non-military assets of Anglo-American/European imperialism.   Because NGOs generally enjoy legal protection to an extent and don't explicitly aid military operations, they are less suspect. This quality allows them to act as trojan horses: excellent tools for undermining socialist/progressive governments. These NGOs get people to support US imperialism with an impressive campaign that's dressed as "radical" and "people oriented", but it actually serves Anglo-American & European financial interests.   Examples include the "Otpor" student movement in Serbia which led to the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. More recent examples include Avaaz, a "human rights" outfit funded by the regime change architect George Soros, and its call for a no-fly zone over Libya and Syria. The imposition of a NATO no-fly zone over Libya was the start of dismantling the social and political gains that the Libyan people under Qadaffi enjoyed for decades, such as universal healthcare, guaranteed housing and a livable wage.
