<'|'>Today on Senator McCains funeralonly one living president is not invited  Donald Trump Till this day he didnt apologize to McCains family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies<'|'>986<'|'>9c2tsl<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9c2tsl/today_on_senator_mccains_funeralonly_one_living/<'|'>29<'|'>15358064510<'|'>In an Op-Ed in today's NYT "Straining to Keep Faith with America" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece "John McCain knew that we are better than Trump."  To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word "maybe" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump.   But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.  Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.  By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like "a shining city on a hill".  But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are "straining to keep Faith with America", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get.   Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, "Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country", have no sway over the minds of these fake "swamp cleaners" like Trump.   Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.  Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.  That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.  Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, "I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul."  Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .<'|'>
