The God Emperor said that we would get tired of winning. *ARE YOU TIRED OF WINNING YET?*  #Feel vindicated, centipedes. It's over and there is nothing they can do about it. We are the FUTURE.   ####This is history. YOU are part of history. The_Donald is part of history.  ####We did it. We knew this in our hearts. No one believed us.

I may not agree with you, I may not even like you but god damnit we (the left) NEED to hear you! Discourse ESPECIALLY with differing views is the only way democracy works, without it this country will never address the problems that face all of us. I voted against Trump and was dissapointed when he won but fucking CHRIST I am outraged when a platform designed to foster discussion and free speech works to censor people it doesn't agree with.

Not everyone is ideologically aligned with /r/The_Donald, and that's okay. We just want to have a seat at the table, the same seat as everyone else, without special rules or stipulations against us.   Our moderation team and community members have been harassed, threatened, and bullied - not only here, but also in real life. We do not encourage harassment or violence or bullying of any kind. Our subreddit rules are clear and are on our sidebar. No subreddit polices its own with such fervor as that of /r/The_Donald. (Heck, even our most loyal centipedes have been banned at some point!)   If they come to soft quarantine us, is your community next? **We want you to know that we are also fighting for you.**  Today /u/spez [finally made an announcement](http://archive.is/vqNs1) regarding the events that transpired last week.   Back in June when the terrorist attack happened in Orlando, Reddit Inc. decided to punish /r/The_Donald instead of /r/news, which was censoring information on where to donate blood to dying Americans. This time after /u/spez manipulated the Reddit database, Reddit Inc. again decided to punish /r/The_Donald.  We wish to point out that our community does NOT deserve to be singled out for harassment. Which rules are /r/The_Donald violating that haven't been addressed by the modteam? It appears that this "compromise" states that while no rules have been broken, Reddit is going to treat /r/The_Donald differently than every single other subreddit. This just brings light to the double-standard that this site continually perpetuates.   On the heels of /u/spez's manipulation of the Reddit database last week, a leak of the secret chat logs of Reddit powermods, admins, and /u/spez was made available on the internet.   &nbsp;  **Reddit and internet culture should not be decided in secret chat rooms in an echo chamber of an elite few.**  We fight this fight not only for ourselves, but also on behalf of everyone who is not represented in that secret chat room.   #All we ask is for us to be treated equally. You should demand the same. #equalrightsonreddit <'|'>

Well, we asked the admins, and this is the response we received...  ####*"Hey all, we've been investigating what happened on that post. We're not seeing any bots or anything like that.

I'd expect it to drop sharply as that catches up with the amount of downvoting happening on the post."*  Sooooooo...yeah.

Look in the mirror of your own actions and words to see what we see....  When we are scared to show our support for our candidate because the media praises your actions against us...   Us getting beaten, our cars getting bashed in, setting cities on fire, spitting on us, attacking us, threatening us...   YOU can freely show support for your candidate.  YOU are praised by the media.   YOU are told it's okay to treat ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, like shit. Since they DO NOT AGREE WITH YOU.   YOU attack the police.   YOU block highways so ambulances cannot reach hospitals.   BUT THATS OKAY BECAUSE WE VOTED FOR TRUMP RIGHT?!   THATS OKAY BECAUSE WE ARE THE MONSTERS RIGHT?!   ITS OKAY BECAUSE WE DESERVE IT RIGHT???.... RIGHT?!   Look in the mirror of your actions below.   -Call me every name in the book.  -Beat me bloody.   -Spit on me.  -Beat my car with a baseball bat.  -Threaten me.  -Set our cities on fire.  Your actions do nothing but further prove the collective points we are all making. You continue to be willfully ignorant instead of listening to your fellow Americans...  I am angry but I choose to not respond with hate, I choose not to respond with violence.... I choose to respond to people who don't want to call me names and who actually want to learn my side of the story instead of listening to the media...    First off... THIS IS WHAT I SEE WHEN I SEE TRUMP.  https://youtu.be/tHsZxJlxHYw   "GET YOUR STUFF AND GET OUT, ITS BEEN PACKED BY THE DOOR SINCE THIS MORNING" A woman screams at her bawling child who voted for Trump in a mock elementary school election....  https://youtu.be/9XJVAMCiUBg  Peaceful protests destroying cities  https://youtu.be/qr8QceLAPq0  https://youtu.be/DmeHRAcDlxs   "RAPE MELANIA!!!" Trending on twitter and signs held up by protestors.  https://youtu.be/tsIzBuC_VOA  Protestors smashing a woman's car...  https://youtu.be/iGUxYjPxzJ8   "I TOLD YOU WE WOULDN'T HELP YOU OR SAVE YOU FOR SPEWING HATE!!" A black man says pointing in a to a black homeless womans face while she lays face down on the ground while people rip up her home made signs and push her belongings over and at even one point kicking her... and for what??? Her exercising her right to protest and protect Donald Trumps star...  https://youtu.be/Tci9R4j63x0  While this is unverified, You think you're doing a good thing by protesting but when you block a highway... People in ambulances could END UP DEAD.   http://conservativefiringline.com/father-4-year-old-girl-dies-thanks-anti-trump-protesters/  "YOU'RE A  RACIST!!!!!!" The crowd yells on your as you try to explain why you're proud of voting for who you did and the words fall on deaf ears. Instead these "peaceful" people beat you and children bloody for their beliefs and our media applauds it...  https://youtu.be/rhmaNz4P4Xw  https://youtu.be/EMux_UHmpvc  https://youtu.be/UHvYgEBBGOM  "TRUMP IS A MISOGYNIST!!!!" The protestor screams as you try to talk calmly and explain his policies yet they keep yelling to keep from hearing the logic in your words  https://youtu.be/MWwRbCR3HQk  Hollywood tells the American people we are wrong and that voting for Hillary will "Save the day"  https://youtu.be/roug-GPE-_0  https://youtu.be/e8hrdJJipJA  https://youtu.be/nRp1CK_X_Yw  "HE VOTED FOR TRUMP!!! THATS WHAT HE GETS!!!" As a white older man is ripped from his car... on film while black young people punch, beat him senseless and steal items out of his car...  https://youtu.be/K2RqdsxVIuI  People cry out for Trump, a man who is a father and a husband... to be killed.   https://youtu.be/vHh2AeeSOMc   http://mobile.wnd.com/2015/12/kill-trump-enraged-left-calls-for-trumps-assassination/  People have already tried...  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/21/why-isnt-the-assassination-attempt-on-donald-trump-bigger-news/  https://youtu.be/QcQT4lqpbOQ  https://youtu.be/dlxK90jTVBQ  https://youtu.be/zErgz09dESs  My question to you is why? Why do you hate and think these things about us? Why do you hate Trump and his supporters?   No. you don't have to support Trump or like us, but when you see the hate towards him and us that is so undeserved. My question to you is why?   Tell me why without returning to your general go to defenses that I have listed above. Those are weak and ignorant.   To all of the people who tell me I'm wrong for voting for Trump that are participating in the actions listed above. Look in the mirror...   I am seen as a terrorist for voting for a man I believe in....  And you are the ones calling us the names.  You are the ones beating US bloody.  You are the ones yelling at your kids and telling them to get out of your house.  YOU are the ones beating up homeless black elderly women and filming it.   YOU are the ones who hate us...  We are not the terrorists...   Look in the mirror to see what we see.    Edit- I know not everyone on the left is like this, I know there are some people who didn't even vote that are giving some of you guys a bad rep. Most of you guys are probably great people, this post was specifically to the ones who are out causing havoc currently.   -The point of this was to just maybe wake a few people up, I do not feel personally attacked currently even though I have been. I see it in the news every day and I see the support and praise for it every day. I do not feel triggered, I am not crying and no I do not need tissues. I posted this because I think it is a load of shit that our media and some people in the government are saying things that condone and support this behavior and in turn support this divide between the American people- and the people who are standing up for everything that USED to be American are deemed sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, islamaphobic, a bigot... Any other name you can possibly think of. If anyone shows any form of patriotism THIS is what they are labeled.   -I am a registered independent myself and vote for the candidate I agree with most in each election(Obama last election). I posted this because I just wanted to write some of the things I was seeing/feeling down and get them out of my head.  -Thank you all so much for your kind words about this post, I did NOT expect for this to be stickied or end up on the freaking front page!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  EDIT-I POSTED THIS AND TRIED POSTING IN OTHER SUBREDDITS WITH OPPOSING VIEWS BUT THEY DO NOT ALLOW TEXT POSTS.    again... THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE SUPPORT AND LOVE... Thank you!!! <'|'>

<'|'>Need a PostMortem Liberals you went too far<'|'>18792<'|'>5cafd5<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5cafd5/need_a_postmortem_liberals_you_went_too_far/<'|'>2370<'|'>14788127120<'|'>A lot will be written about this election in the coming days, months, and years. I have refrained from putting out any long-winded explanations because, well, quite frankly, I’ve been too busy celebrating. I haven’t stopped smiling in two days.  But as I see many of my more-liberal friends posting their own diagnoses – usually blaming racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc – I think it is prudent to throw my two cents in. You don’t have to believe me. Then again, you didn’t believe me when I said Trump would win by way of the Rust Belt a year and a half ago or when I said all of the polls were wrong. But these are minor details…  I want to say this as clearly as possible: **Liberals, you went too far.**  All of the polling data showed that the majority of Americans supported compassionate immigration reform. You turned around and called for a pathway to citizenship that would have shifted American electoral politics dramatically to the left for decades to come. President Barack Obama, after saying no less than 30 times that he didn’t have the legal authority to do so, decided to bypass Congress and give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants by executive order. When a Federal judge ordered the administration to stop, they kept sending out amnesty paperwork anyway. When Kate Steinle was murdered by a five-time deported illegal immigrant in a Sanctuary City, you spoke out in favor of letting potential-killers roam the streets to further your commitment to political correctness. Instead of looking at the real pain caused by illegal immigration in this country, you went to bat for people whose first act in this country was to break our laws. **You went too far on immigration and you lost.**  Most polling data shows that a plurality of Americans support sensible “common sense” gun control. This election season, you defined the term “common sense” for the first time… and it was terrifying. You chose a Presidential candidate who promised to eliminate the individual right to keep and bear arms by reversing the very Supreme Court case (Heller v DC) that affirmed that Americans have the right to own a gun. You nominated a candidate who promised to ban entire categories of weapons based not on their lethality, but on what attachments they have and what they look like. **You went too far on gun control and you lost.**  The vast majority of Americans supported the idea of revamping healthcare to make it affordable. Instead of working alongside Republicans, you jammed a healthcare bill down our throats using a parliamentary maneuver that allowed it to pass without a single Republican vote. One of your chief architects of the ACA said, on camera, that the law passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. When faced with the reality of premiums skyrocketing and health insurance companies leaving the system all together, you refused to admit that people were upset because you went too far. Instead, you nominated a candidate who argued the system was falling apart because we didn’t go far enough. **You went too far on healthcare and you lost.**  The majority of Americans support the idea of “free trade.” But you nominated a candidate who called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the “gold standard of trade agreements,” a candidate who celebrated, alongside her husband, when NAFTA passed and when China entered the WTO. When Democrats had the chance to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, 14 Senate Democrats voted alongside Republicans to give the President power to negotiate on it further. Those same Democrats voted for a companion bill (Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2015) to set-aside billions of dollars to retrain the hundreds of thousands of Americans who would lose their jobs as a result of TPP. **You went too far on trade and you lost the entire Rust Belt as a result.**  The country was roughly split 50/50 on the issue of abortion. Donald Trump stood on a Presidential debate stage and say that yes, if elected his Supreme Court judges would overturn Roe v Wade. Four years ago, many said Romney lost the election because of his “binders full of women.” By any measure, Donald Trump’s statement should have lost him the election. But he only received 1% less support among women than Mitt Romney did. Why? Because right after he said he wanted to overturn Roe v Wade, his opponent declared she believes abortion should be legal up until the date of delivery, which not only terrifies me as someone who was born significantly pre-mature, but it also goes directly against the viability test set forth in Roe v Wade. **You went too far on abortion and you lost.**  Contrary to the liberal talking points coming out over the past few days, the vast majority of the country believes in equal rights for people of color. Instead of building off of this common ground, Black Lives Matter popped up and the nightly news was filled with images of African Americans rioting and burning black neighborhoods to the ground. Police Officers began getting gunned down in the streets and yet Democratic Congressmen and Senators promoted this organization from the floor of the House and Senate. Even today, after Donald Trump won the Presidency in a landslide, disgruntled African Americans are being caught on camera savagely beating White citizens, simply because they voted for Donald Trump. **You went too far on the issue of race and you lost.**  Many on the Left, throughout this election, said that Donald Trump’s message was devoid of specifics. If you were one of them, then you weren’t paying attention. Donald Trump’s campaign was completely issue-based. He won by a landslide because he isolated every single thing that the Left went too far on and promised to right the ship.  While you were salivating over the prospect of 11 million illegal aliens being given citizenship and added to the voter rolls, Donald Trump was meeting with families who had loved ones killed by illegal aliens that Barack Obama refused to deport. While you used the San Bernardino attack and the Orlando Massacre to push for more gun control, Donald Trump stood on stage and promised to keep the violent Muslim extremism that caused these attacks “the hell out of our country.” While you called Donald Trump the most anti-gay candidate ever, he was going off script at the Republican Convention, thanking delegates for applauding his plan to keep the LGBT community safe. He was standing on stage at a rally in Colorado holding up a gay pride flag.   You believed that Trump’s comments about illegal aliens and certain women would spell certain defeat for the maverick billionaire. Now that the dust has settled, exit polls show Donald Trump winning 1% more of the Latino vote and only getting 1% less of the women vote than Mitt Romney did. You were wrong.  By all means, continue to post about how you think Donald Trump’s victory was caused by prevalent racism or sexism or some other -ism. That is your right and I will defend it to the death. But Hillary Clinton didn’t lose this election because of an –ism. She lost this election because the American people rejected every single part of your platform and until you realize this, you are going to keep losing.  One line that was repeated throughout the campaign when the pundits thought Trump was melting down was a Napoleonic quote: Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. It would be easy to say this now as Clinton supporters blame everyone but themselves for this historic electoral result.  But at the end of the day, this proverb doesn’t fit because you’re not my enemy. You are my friend, my neighbor, my countryman. We voted to Make America Great Again for all Americans and I sincerely believe that you will be pleasantly surprised. <'|'>

Barely any of them have been reported on because of this bullshit Russia conspiracy theory that is swallowing the MSM. He has literally "Done more in 97days than Obama did in 8 years." This is not only a running list of promises he has kept so far, but also things he has done that weren't even promised on the campaign trail. MAGA. (I will be updating this as much as I can, whenever a new initiative comes to light)  Edit: Much like our AMAZING president, I have been incredibly busy for the past six months and I apologize for not staying up-to-date. I have gotten many requests to update it and finally have some extra time on my hands, so a big update with many, new YUGE promises kept will be coming soon. The last time I edited it was after his first 100 Days, and this is going to be a six month update.

The cognitive dissonance is very real! It has been an incredible 6 months of only his first term, and America has already gotten much greater!

No more selling American workers out so that special interests can import cheap labor or manufacture their goods overseas to make more money for their stockholders. There's a reason that Hillary Clinton deleted the paragraph about her supporting the Trans Pacific Partnership when they released a new edition of her latest memoir... She thinks the American people are too stupid to realize she is diametrically opposed to *their* interests.  Also, Hillary Clinton approved CIA drone strikes on a non-secure blackberry, over OpenNET, while travelling abroad. She put national security and the lives of intelligence assets at risk because she believes she's above the law. She would make history if elected. She would be the first President to have to leave the room for her own intelligence briefing because she lacked a security clearance.  Trump is also the only candidate who has openly said that he would instruct his DOJ to seek an indictment against Hillary Clinton if the facts support it.  Though a billionaire, Donald Trump refused to allow special interests to finance his primary campaign. He is only interested in delivering for the American people, not the organizations that write campaign checks. He'd rather burn his own money than be beholden to those who act against the interests of the American people.  Vote Trump. Make America Great Again. Send Hillary to Prison.  **EDIT:** As to the person who gave me Gold, thank you for acknowledging how shitty this post was. But I would have rather you went out back and burned your money instead of contributing to this crooked system.  **EDIT2:** Seriously, whoever was just the second person to give me gold, I wasn't kidding. Please burn your money before donating it to the very entity we're protesting against. Rather counterintuitive.  [**Very strange dynamic...**](https://i.sli.mg/1OSGhY.png)  **EDIT3:** First two times were funny, but please stop gilding this. Donate your money to [one of these veterans charities](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/31/list-veterans-groups-receiving-trump-fundraiser-donations.html) instead.<'|'>

Nobody was indicted nobody was charged with this crime and as far as we know there are no suspects. According to the media reports the FBI under Comey was so uninterested in this case that they are not even investigating it right now. The D.C. police stonewalled any press inquiries for more information.  The press reported that police is treating this as a robbery gone wrong even though none of the high value items or cash were taken from Rich. In recent days many main stream outlets dedicated significant attention to the Seth Rich case. The Drudge Report, Fox News Channel, Hannity and many other outlets highlighted new information coming to light in this case. Reports emerged that a Federal investigator reviewed information indicating Seth Rich was in communication with Wikileaks through an intermediary. Though there is no confirmation of this from Wikileaks, the organization offered a $20k reward for information shortly after the murder, something which they have never done before. The DNC for which Seth Rich worked as a staffer also joined in and they decided to graciously offer an amount of $0 .   The alt-left propaganda media responded with the statements  of  [Brad Bauman a professional  Democrat crisis PR consultant with the Pastorum Group.](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763852003093217280) Of course the fact that he is a crisis PR consultant was never mentioned in any of the alt-left propaganda articles or coverage.    Let's try to gather all the facts, (with sources) that pertain to the murder of Seth Rich, a patriot and Bernie supporter megathread style. I will update the thread as you post valuable information relating to this case.  __________________  TIMELINE  **July 10 4:20 AM, 2016, Seth Conrad Rich, a DNC staffer and patriot, is murdered in Washington D.C.**  July 10   Rich was found conscious but later died in the [hospital](http://archive.is/FGwOO) Newsweek reported that police said he may have been killed in an attempted robbery, although nothing had apparently been taken [from him.](http://archive.is/EWASt)  July 12, 2016, Sanders officially endorses Clinton.  July 22, 2016, Wikileaks begins the release of 44,000 emails from the DNC spanning a period from January 2015 to May 25, 2016.  July 27, 2016, Clinton is confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee by the DNC.  August 9, 2016, Wikileaks officially offers $20,000 for information about Seth Rich's murder, a previously unprecedented act.   August 11, 2016 It becomes public that **Brad Bauman** a professional  [Democrat crisis PR consultant](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763852003093217280) became the "family spokesperson" for the Seth Rich family. A position he maintained ever since, showing the questions surrounding the murder of Seth Rich were considered a "crisis" for Democrats.    August, 2016 Statement of Julian Assange about Seth Rich "Our sources take risks and they become concerned when such things happen. Our sources face serious risk... [We are investigating to try to understand what happened with Seth Rich"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg).

The laptop is at an unknown location.   May, 18 2017 In a Democrat Party FUD campaign, their Crisis PR operative [Brad Bauman](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763852003093217280) places several statements in Democrat-allied press calling the claims of Rod Wheeler the investigator working on the Seth Rich case into question.  May 20, 2017 A lawyer **Joseph Ingrisano** sends a threatening legal letter to Rod Wheeler to try stop him from speaking out on this case. Ingrisano claims to want to protect the "memory of Seth Rich". The letter is immediately sent to [John Podesta's current employer the Washington Post](http://archive.is/yJsEN#selection-4131.0-4131.259), which promptly publishes parts of it. While printing statements from [Brad Bauman](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763852003093217280) in the same article the Washington Post refuses to notify their readers that **Brad Bauman** is a Democrat crisis PR consultant, [keeping their own readers ignorant and misinformed.](http://archive.is/yJsEN#selection-4179.173-4179.222) _______________________________  other information  A message from the parents of Seth Rich https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BEsacP9vWA&feature=youtu.be please watch.

<'|'>UNDECIDED VOTERS Here is why you should vote Trump and tear down the establishment<'|'>17148<'|'>5bnmiu<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bnmiu/undecided_voters_here_is_why_you_should_vote/<'|'>1463<'|'>14785412060<'|'>We've heard a lot this election seasons from the mainstream media scaremongering about Trump in order to convince you to vote Hillary, and a lot of that comes from organizations who have a vested interest in keeping establishment politicians in power. This has lead a lot of Redditors to be entirely ignorant of Trump's actual ideas, drowned out in the sea of sensationalist propaganda against Trump.  So with a day before the election I've decided to compile a list of reasons I think Trump would make a good president and actually shake up Washington:  * Against the TPP treaty which threatens to destroy jobs and give more power to global corporations, while Hillary called it the “Gold Standard”. [Source](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-vows-to-cancel-trans-pacific-partners/)  * Wants to limit U.S. hegemony via not being the world’s police. He is against nation building wars and breaks from GOP orthodoxy by wanting to be mostly non-interventionist. Hillary on the other hand has a [long record of war mongering](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/) and [dominating in campaign donations](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/defense-industry-hillary-clinton-227336) from military/defense contractors. Everyone should [watch Trump's foreign policy speech where he sounded very presidential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW8RqLN3Qao&t=6m20s)  * Wants to impose term limits on Congress. 75% of Americans support creating term limits on Congress, and Congress has dismal approval.  [Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-18/trump-proposes-term-limits-for-congress-to-drain-the-swamp)  * Ethics reform to limit lobbyism: wants to stop the link between corporate donors buying up politicians which is one of the biggest problems in our government. He has created a 5 point plan in order to achieve this, including expanding the ["definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors"](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trumps-five-point-plan-for-ethics-reform)   * Himself is highly resistant to lobbyism and special interest influence. [He is a reluctant politician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEPs17_AkTI), and doesn't need the donor money to get rich. He could have lived the rest of his life in extreme wealth and luxury instead of running for office, he's the only candidate ever for whom the Air Force One will be a downgrade in luxury as he currently owns a custom private 757.  * Lower taxes, while at the same time closing tax loopholes for Wall Street bankers such as carried interest. What does this mean for you? Well here is a [calculator where you can compare how much taxes you would pay under Trump and Hillary](http://www.clark.com/tax-calculator-clinton-trump)  * Knows firsthand how dishonest, biased and corrupt the mainstream media is. Just like Bernie Sanders said the AT&T/Time Warner merger must be stopped, [Trump has said he would break up such media consolidation](http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/22/media/donald-trump-att-time-warner/) putting him further to the left of Obama who allowed the Comcast/NBC merger.  * Wants to audit the Fed, just like Ron Paul did.   * He’s very pro-2nd Amendment. Got the earliest endorsement from the NRA ever.  * While he is perfectly fine with allowing in legal immigrants, he has a strong anti illegal-immigration policy, [including de-funding sanctuary cities and going after corporations who hire illegal immigrants rather than Americans.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/immigration) This has actually become a huge problem, with [illegal immigration costing American $113 BILLION a year](http://www.fairus.org/issues/publications/state-cost-studies). Hillary wants to FLOOD America with mass amounts of third worlders and grant illegal immigrants citizenships, as polling shows they are more likely to vote Democrat in future elections.   * Pro-Nuclear Energy  * Goes strongly against PC culture that has unfortunately gained a stranglehold on much of our society since neo-progressivism came into vogue (Hillary is pro Black Lives Matter and believes in the Wage Gap)  * Will repeal common core  * Pro-medical marijuana, and letting states decided whether to legalize  * Anti-Globalist: He takes a strong stance against the collusion of international financiers like George Soros with Washington insiders, and wants to make national interests take precedence over the profits of huge global corporations.   * Wants to end corporate inversion and discourage offshoring  * Understands the threat of Sharia Law and Radical Islamic Terrorism. Meanwhile Hillary holds [very regressive left views on Islam](http://thefederalist.com/2016/09/19/hillary-clinton-rather-blame-free-speech-islam-terrorism/) and defends authoritarian Islamist states like Saudi Arabia (while proclaiming to be for women's rights).  * Plans to push for 6 weeks paid maternal leave as standard and allow families to deduct from their income taxes child care expenses.  * Wants to work together with Russia in stopping Jihadi's in Syria instead of being adversaries   * Knows NATO needs to be rejiggered to focus on terrorism instead of just continuing a Cold War with Russia and bombing countries  * Wants to end healthcare monopolies by promoting competitive bidding  * Despite the hoopla that came from the "grab them by the pussy" tape, Trump has been hiring women into senior positions for decades, before it was common. He actually isn't sexist and wants to see women succeed, [and nobody will tell you this more than his former female employees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-a-champion-of-women-his-female-employees-think-so/2015/11/23/7eafac80-88da-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html)  * Knows how fucked up the Saudis are like the rest of us, while Hillary takes in millions from them  * Wants to end the incompetence and corruption at the VA   Not only that but [he has been talking about these issues for decades now](https://youtu.be/OCabT_O0YSM). Unlike career politicians like Hillary who gain their wealth from selling political favors to corporate and foreign donors, Trump is beholden to nobody. He knowingly took the risk of running for president with an anti-establishment platform which has not only put his life in danger, but put him in the crossfire to be constantly called racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic and all the other buzzwords the establishment uses to socially peer pressure to continue voting for their candidates.   The fact that Wall Street hates Trump and love Hillary, the fact that the career politicians hate Trump, the fact that the media is almost entirely promoting Hillary and bashing Trump, should tell you everything. They have set up a system that keeps the people pacified into inaction as the wealth inequality increases every year.  Only 30% of Americans are satisfied with the current direction the country is going according to Gallup polls, we have a record 94 million Americans not in the workforce, nearly 7 in 10 Americans have less than $1,000 in savings,  young people struggle to finds jobs and America is continually slipping in most indicators of global power. While the graph of national GDP as percentage of world GDP skyrockets for China, it continually slides down for America. The establishment have enriched themselves while destroying the working class. Don't fall for their scaremongering about Trump.  [Drain the Swamp](https://streamable.com/q3s2)  <'|'>

Whether you're here for real news, the best AMA's, or some good old-fashioned memes, Reddit's at its best when you-not Reddit admins-decide what you see on r\/all. Today, The_Donald is calling on you to be the heroes we need. Please go to https://shop.donaldjtrump.com/ and show Trump how much you support him. -The_Donald Mods    While Reddit admins and various subs are busy creaming themselves to out-virtue-signal one another and raise awareness for *net neutrality* by professing that all data should be treated equally, we're going to call them out for the hypocrites that they are. ([rest of reddit](http://i.magaimg.net/img/yui.png))  # **\#AllDataMatters**   So you want all data to be treated equally? Then Dear Admin, why don't you start with Reddit and practicing what you preach, instead of applying special rules that only affect one DOMreddit - You guessed it: r/The_Donald.   Reddit has in effect become an apartheid state where Pedes are the second class citizens - simply because of our politics. They didn't want our guy to win - he did win despite all the odds and they're eternally triggered that we helped him win. I firmly believe that it is the very pinnacle of liberal hypocrisy to advocate for equal treatment of information on one hand while actively treating information unequally on the other.  Here are massa's rules that only apply to us ornery self-thinking field redditors:  * Our stickied posts are blocked from appearing on r\/all, no matter how popular they are.    * Even posts not sticked that would organically hit r\/all are blocked if we use ANY stickies at all.  * Other subs are allowed to direct link to our comments and posts (often to brigade), but we are forced to remove even the mention of any other sub or we face quick reprisal. * Other subs frequently mention our mods and users by name (often to harass), but we can't even call them out to defend ourselves or our mods will be banned.  Additionally:  * We are constantly under attack from brigades and downvote bots that hit /new and have been for months. We have tried to address this with the admins and have been ignored. * They allow dozens of barely active anti-Trump subreddits to blatantly use bots to push their agenda to the front page. Even regular [redditors are sick of it](http://i.magaimg.net/img/yuq.png) * They allow blanket banning from other subreddits simply for posting in r/The_Donald - Even when users have never posted in those subreddits. * They allow the open distribution of scripts advertised solely for mass tagging r/The_Donald users in RES so that they may be harassed outside of the DOMreddit, creating a "reddit ghetto". The thread is still up and the user who clearly violated reddit TOS has never been dealt with despite being reported to the admins. * r/The_Donald is the only place on reddit where [4/4 = 0.99 and 13/13 = 0.98](http://i.magaimg.net/img/yur.png) We are subject to special algorithms that do not show the actual raw vote count but rather weight votes. **This does not apply to any other subreddit.**  #Make no mistake - reddit does NOT stand with net neutrality.  They actively prioritize content they agree with, and penalize content they disagree with.  Actions speak louder than words.   ---  **To our fellow pedes:**  Despite this unfair treatment meant to keep us down and hide us away, this DOMreddit has continued to grow because of all your high-energy. We thank you.  **To the larger reddit community**  Recently, we were proud to see not just a few, but all of Reddit speak out against the unfair treatment by CNN towards a fellow redditor and we hope that you will not remain silent now in the face of Reddit's unequal treatment towards this community.   **To the Reddit Admins:**  > The time is always right to do what is right. - MLK Jr.    Signed, \#ThePersistence <'|'>

<'|'>A Simple Guide to the Clinton Foundation Corruption<'|'>16923<'|'>5bbira<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bbira/a_simple_guide_to_the_clinton_foundation/<'|'>374<'|'>14783725590<'|'>**Executive Summary**: Hillary and Bill Clinton have used their charity to collect funds from government and corporate services in exchange for political favors. The direct evidence of how the transactions occurred or what was given has not been fully explored. What we do know is that three governments have given to the Clinton Foundation Endowment without any specified goal. Those countries are Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the UAE. Qatar  donated to the Cinton Global Initiative with no purpose specified for the money. Beyond these countries, we know from the emails that the Clinton’s knew their foundation was at risk of being exposed.  When Chelsea Clinton was put on the board, she immediately began to sniff out the corruption. Her concerns really annoyed the Foundation Staff. She believed her parents were being duped and not complicit in the acts. They restructured the charity at the end of 2011 to hide their wrong-doings and two long-time Clinton aides founded a private company called Teneo Holdings. Which served as the legal method for the Clinton’s to continue their wrong doing. So far, I have been able to discover evidence from the Podesta emails that they colluded with the United Nations Development Programme to give $100M from the SIDS fund to GE, under the guise of a “contest” in 2011-2012. There is also detailed plans about using the energy-related branch of the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Climate Initiative) to create a source of income for the Clintons, especially once Hillary left the State Department and they could make deals directly with foreign governments.  &nbsp;  **Acronyms**:  •	CGI – Clinton Global Initiative  •	CCI – Clinton Climate Initiative  •	CESC- Clinton Executive Services Corp  •	CF- Clinton Foundation   •	CHAI - Clinton Health Access Initiative  &nbsp;  **Major Players besides the Clintons**:  •	Douglas Band – long-time personal assistant to Bill Clinton. Band started his role while Bill was in office and stayed with him to help establish the Clinton Foundation. He is the creator of the Clinton Global Initiative, which allowed the Clinton’s to accept foreign aid. Band left his role at the Clinton Foundation to form the company Teneo holdings (with Declan Kelly), but retained his CF role as an "advisor".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Band    •	Declan Kelly – A “leading advisor” and top fundraiser to the Hillary Clinton 2008 election campaign. He was rewarded for his efforts by being appointed to the role of Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland. He would leave that position to found the Teneo Holding company with Douglas Band. Many political blogs say that his time at the state department was entirely spent travelling the country and making business connections. He is also reported to have gone to Northern Ireland after being appointed and telling the Enterprise minister that his role was “strictly economical, and not political”.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Kelly_(businessperson)    •	Ira Magaziner – A part of the Clinton Presidential administration, he worked directly with Hillary Clinton to create the failed Task Force for Health Care Reform. In 1997 he was fined for having used the money to pay for non-government employees. The fine was dismissed in court in 1999. He went to work for the Clinton Foundation after they left office, and currently serves as CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). Additionally, (and most importantly) he is involved with CCI in their various renewable energy projects  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Magaziner  •	Huma Abedin - Personal aide to Hillary Clinton since 1996. Huma simultaneously as deputy chief of staff to  the Secretary of State, a paid Clinton Foundation executive, and a consultant for Teneo. A special government employee arrangement was created by Hillary Clinton to allow Huma's outside employment.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin#State_Department.2C_Clinton_Foundation.2C_Teneo.2C_2009.E2.80.932013  •	Cheryl Mills – A long-time Clinton lawyer, and the one who defended Bill during his impeachment trial. She was Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff for her entire tenure as Secretary of State.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Mills    •	Ilya Aspis – special assistant to Bill Clinton at the Clinton Foundation.  &nbsp;  **Timeline**:  •	Prior to 2011, the Clintons were using the charity without scrutiny for personal profit  •	At some point there was pressure applied to the Clinton Foundation, I did find an email where they were leaked (ahead of time) an incoming inquiry by the State Department. Unfortunately, I misplaced the link to that email, but it is in there somewhere.   •	Simpson Thacher and & Bartlett (a law firm) audited the foundation to see if they had exposure; they found evidence of conflicts-of-interest  •	Cheryl Mills, John Podesta, and Douglas Band all worked together to restructure the Clinton Foundation in a way that would allow them to continue their practices.    •	Enter Teneo. In the re-structuring document, the role of Teneo is described as a way for Bill Clinton to maintain his consulting role   •	In 2011, Chelsea was appointed to the Clinton Foundation board and immediately began hearing reports of corruption with Teneo  •	She voiced these concerns to her father and mother. They referred her to Cheryl Mills, while she worked at the state department secretary as chief counsel.  	  •	In Late 2011 and 2012, Ira Magaziner spear-headed an effort to work with the UN to pay GE 100M for instituting an island energy initiative. The entire cost for the Clinton Foundation was supposedly subsidized by the UN. Additionally, Ira used the opportunity to personally enrich himself and his co-workers.   •	In Ira’s energy documents he discusses how the firm has created solar parks in India and South Africa with the aid of various banking institutes. Oddly, these are not mentioned on the CCI website and there is an email where the CF staff seems to be concerned about the CF role in Gujurat’s (India) solar park.   &nbsp;  **Companies Involved with Teneo at the very beginning who were also donors to the Clinton Foundation**:  -The Coca-Cola Company-   -The Dow Chemical Company   -UBS  -The American Ireland Fund (AIF)  -The All-State Corporation  -Barclays Capital  -Indo Gold  -GEMS Education  -The Rockefeller Foundation  -Laureate International Universities  &nbsp;   **These are the companies who did not contribute to CF, but were Teneo client's at its very beginning**:   ATT   Black Diamond   Bank of America    Firebird   Liberty Mutual   Stone Harbor  Frank Stronach   TiVo   UBS AG   Mylan  &nbsp;  **The Email Proof**  &nbsp;  This is an email where they discuss the potential exposure they would have if they moved the CESC into the same office as the Clinton Foundation. This took place around the time they were attempting to restructure. When this was proposed they were still under a lease obligation. The concern about the exposure and the landlord leaking information about an empty office can be seen here:   https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/45082   >a. Do we want to move these personnel from Harlem?  Keep in mind that we risk exposure because it will mean GSA is paying for an empty 8600 squarefeet until August 2014, our first out option. We have landlords who aren’t happy we moved most of our operations out of their building and wouldn’t mind leaking an empty floor to the press.  >b.  **If we are okay with taking the exposure risk, do we envision the auditors coming back and recommending (and BC accepting) that CESC shouldnot operate within CF space even with a sub-lease agreement?**  >c.  The advantages of course are obvious – better business continuity, management, etc.  &nbsp;   The following email is the results of the internal audit conducting by the law firm. From the attached document, I have taken the following excerpt:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/44431  >a.	The Foundation has a Conflict-of-Interest Policy applicable to directors, officers, and key employees and a separate policy for other employees.  Publicize and conduct training to familiarize employees about these policies and/or how they are implemented.  >b.	The Foundation has a  longstanding policy regarding outside employment.  In general, the Foundation’s Code of Conduct provides that employees wishing to obtain employment outside of the Foundation must first secure the approval of their immediate supervisor, which may be granted or denied in the supervisor’s sole discretion, after consultation with the Director of Human Resources.  Publicize and conduct training to familiarize employees about these policies and/or how they are implemented.     >c.	In general, hold regular training sessions regarding Foundation policies.  Set the tone at the top and encourage a culture where policies are understood and compliance is the norm.    >d.	Ensure that staff is aware of reporting lines and that managers at all levels are aware of their responsibility to enforce policies.  Establish clear pathways to obtain clarification when needed in applying policies to specific situations.  >e.	Educate the Board and staff as to proper and timely disclosure of conflicts of interest.  Instruct officers and managers to educate staff as to provisions of the employee conflicts policy and how to raise conflicts with managers as conflicts arise.    >f.	Adopt a clear gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted.  >g.	Have all CGI “comp Memberships” vetted by CGI Management to ensure that all such Membership offers advance the interests of CGI.  &nbsp;   In response to this, Cheryl Mills proposes her restructuring to avoid potential investigations. The following has an email attachment that was drafted by Cheryl Mills. In the attachment she outlines why they need to restructure the entire foundation. Below is a direct quote from the attachment:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46634  >**Currently, the President personally compensates certain employees to perform duties that fall outside of the scope of the Foundation entities’ mission.  These employees support the President’s business, personal, former president and political activity, while also providing support for Foundation activity (for which their services are billed to the Foundation**  &nbsp;  Here is where they further discuss an issue of letting CESC employees retain CESC benefits while working for the Clinton Foundation (as was done previously). They are concerned that doing so will not create the “perception” that there is a divide between the CESC and CF.  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38408  >HR and I had a follow up discussion and HR reminded me that CESC is currently served by the multi plan benefit network and thus would this new CESC allow it's employees currently accessing CF benefits to retain those benefits rather than force them to switch to CF. **I thought this would be legally difficult if we are trying to formalize the lines, perception and real, but you all tell me**  &nbsp;  **ENTER STAGE LEFT: TENEO AND CHELSEA**  After Teneo was created, Chelsea Clinton smelled something fishy about the whole thing and started investigating it. Here are a few of the claims she was concerned about:   https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39916   >A former MF Global employee accused former president William J. Clinton of collecting $50,000 per month through his Teneo advisory firm in the months before the brokerage careened towards its Halloween filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  >Teneo was hired by MF Global’s former CEO Jon S. Corzine to improve his image and to enhance his connections with Clinton’s political family, said the employee, who asked that his name be withheld because he feared retribution.   Why would Jon Corzine do that for Bill Clinton? Because they had been friends for a long time… He served on a presidential committee for Bill Clinton and on a Department of Treasury’s borrowing committee. Take a look through the MF Global bankruptcy and the whole thing reeks:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Global     Here is another lovely quote from that same email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39916   > voiced serious concerns to Bari - including telling her Ilya has called Members of the House and Members of Parliament, "on behalf of President Clinton," for Teneo clients (eg for Andrew Liveris and Dow who's coming this month to London), without my father's knowledge and inelegantly and ineffectually at best and at worse has now precipitating people in London making comparisons between my father and Tony Blair's profit motivations.    Chelsea voiced her concerns to her parents and they referred her to… Cheryl Mills. Here is an outline of several more allegations Chelsea is concerned about:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31334  >- **today that Doug reached out to someone at Harry Walker (who represents my father on all speaking arrangements), to ask for a full list of all his speeches, how much he was paid for each speech, and told the contact person at Harry Walker that all speeches should now go through him, not Terry Krinivic (the scheduler)**  >- that Ilya physically saw/caught Justin a couple of days ago reading his bberry and loading the same spyware onto his computer that he loaded onto Bari's computer   > - a secret service agent told Marc (my husband) that Justin had asked another secret service agent to lie about the parking pass absurdity [we > can talk about this really ridiculous anecdote offline]   > - multiple people shared with me how upset they were at hearing how Justin referred to my father in the last week - in very derogatory ways widely sadly   > - Oscar told my father he knows Justin reads his emails  > - **my father was told today of explicit examples at CGI of Doug/ Teneo pushing for - and receiving - free memberships - and of multiple examples of Teneo 'hustling' business at CGI - and of people now having quit at CGI**   > - that Doug told Jon Davidson he was never going to forgive him for not reporting that Dad met with John (ie you John) on Sunday and that how could Jon forget who he really worked for   >-  Doug told Terry Krinivic she would never work again in this town if she didn't back him up on everything   > - **Ilya believes Hannah and Justin have taken significant sums of money from my parents personally - some in expenses - cars, etc. - and others directly*   Cheryl worked to downplay the information and collude with Band, Podesta, and the other CF staffers to solve the issue. The following explains why she did not interact herself:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42061  >**Cheryl, Victoria told me you were not able to work out how to become covered under privilege.** As such, she recommended our meeting and call be only my father, the Board and John. My father wants it to be Bruce, John, me and him.   Band loses it after all of this speculation only against him and his company Teneo. The following are email exchanges where he has complaining about the hypocrisy, because other top CF staff also have external employers/influence:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21496   >Justin and I already are not employees of the foundation. We are employees of cesc. But we could make it more official as advisors to it or something. Otherwise, raising money for it would be odd with no connectivity  > Ira runs chai and has been doing outside consulting all these years   > Bob harrison has a ton of goldman stock and makes decisions on gold mans engagement/role in cgi   > Valerie uses office space of a donor in chicago   > Bruce was paid by his law firm for years and may still be   > People sit on boards, for profit ones and not for profit ones   > I am sure there are many others we don't know about   Another exchange:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46430   >I have to agree. I think there WJC may have some real serious conflicts if we start to make too many rules. **It may be time to update some procedures but we can not ignore the nexus of WJC's life. **     > Also. I signed a conflict of interest policy as a board member of cgi. On it, I wrote that my wife designs bags for cgi, and loses money doing so plus donating her time.**And that teneo represents 4 cgi sponsors, 3 of which teneo brought to cgi. Oddly, wjc does not have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by 3 cgi sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc**   > I could add 500 different examples of things like this and while I removed lasry bc they are all on the offense, I get the sense that they are trying to put some sort of wrong doing on me after the audit as a crutch to change things and if I don't mention things like lasry where they all have issues, I may regret it   &nbsp;  And, in the words of DJ Khaled, another one…  &nbsp;  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36761    > I'm also starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed. Dk and I built a business. 65 people work for us who have wives and husbands and kids, they all depend on us. Our business has almost nothing to do with the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way. The chairman of ubs could care a less about cgi. Our fund clients who we do restructuring and m and a advising the same just as bhp nor tivo do. These are real companies who we provide real advice to through very serious people. Comm head for goldman, dep press secretary to bloomberg, former head of banking, and his team, from morgan stanley for asia and latin am.  &nbsp;  Another one:  &nbsp; https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42839   >For teneo, well before mf global, we have been discussing this. Its going to hurt teneo to have wjc on the adv bd any longer but we need come up with a reorg concept for the relationship with wjc and teneo that is lower key and handled privately and properly that we should discuss  &nbsp;  Another one:   https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46199   >I just received a call from a close friend of wjcs who said that cvc told one of the bush 43 kids that she is conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi to the foundation. The bush kid then told someone else who then told an operative within the republican party. I have heard more and more chatter of cvc and bari talking about lots of what is going on internally to people. Not smart   This was Podesta's reply: >**You are perfecting your skills for understatement**  &nbsp;  In 2013, Band was still feeling very vulnerable. So he decided to write a letter about himself, send it to John Podesta, and have John Podesta send it out. The letter can be found as an attachment, but this is an excerpt from the email itself:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17376  >Thank you again for doing this, means more to me than you know.     > Had a hard time writing this as you can imagine. I spent hours in front of a blank screen so I had some help from my teen folks. **Tried to tone it down but will let you have a look**   &nbsp;      **The Story of How Ira (and Bill Clinton) Stole His Piece of the $100M UN Pie**  This following is about the CCI (Clinton Climate Initiative):  One of the major programs involved with CCI is the island energy campaign. Where they facilitate the installation of solar energy systems on Island nations. The whole idea was supposedly drawn up by GE, according to this excerpt:  >GE has approached about jointly developing a model high-renewable island (GE has a pilot in Hawaii, where they're helping the govt figure out how to go from 0% to 60% renewables - the idea would be to apply this to select island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific). The World Bank/IFC has offered to fund. Others want to be involved as well.  The link can be found here, it is at the very bottom of the chain: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9995  &nbsp;  Here is an excerpt on the role CF might play. Notice how it talks entirely about GE. There’s a brief mention of their willingness to work with Siemens in these emails, but the entire idea seems driven by GE:  > On a broad level, Clinton Foundation would manage the political relationship (Grenada, Maldives, Samoa, etc), and do the early-stage development work - the initial business planning, walking govt and the local utility through the economics and financing, advising through the RFP and policy process, etc.  >GE would provide the technical perspective: resource assessment, grid modelling, system design and integration, advanced renewable and smart grid technology, etc. Especially for the first few flagship islands, GE would be willing to devote significant R&D and engineering resources from GE Energy, from their Ecomagination program and from their R&D labs.   &nbsp;  From that same email chain, we have reference to Hillary Clinton’s ability to reach out to Island nations and get them on board:  >Let me know if you have any thoughts on this (positive or negative). I would love to begin floating it during the APEC conference in Hawaii in mid-November. I believe Secretary Clinton will be there, as will many representatives from Pacific Island governments.  &nbsp;  It all seems like good charity work until we get to these two emails. The first shows that they will present the entire thing as a “contest” and use UN funds to give to GE when they “win” the contest:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36510   >**The UNDP has indicated they want to support CCI, via the SIDS DOCK Island Fund. This is a $100mn fund that was established at the Copenhagen conference** ($40mn has been raised to date)  >**We are considering a new approach, to structure the initiative as a "contest" - challenging the private sector (ie GE, Siemens, Vestas, etc) to design an innovative island-wide renewable energy plan**. Something that takes a specific island to a specific target - say 80% or even 100% renewables (wind, solar, waste, hydro). **The "winning" plan would be financed via the SIDS DOCK fund**.  &nbsp;  I did not place those quotes in there, look for yourself. Beyond the collusion insinuated here to give 100m in UN funds to GE under the guise of a “contest”. Ira Magaziner apparently saw this as his opportunity to enrich himself and his team:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17472  >Someone should go back to WJC and confirm that he approved the Island initiative "as is" including the $1 million Clinton Foundation budget (over and above any funding from UNDP), **which budget includes a $100,000 salary for Ira (on top of his CHAI salary) and a staff of nine (despite the fact that one of the people who works for Ira says that most of this staff is unnecessary)** and that he agreed to split the Swedish post code lottery funds which means that we will have to use Clinton Foundation funds to fund our AFL-CIO/pension fund retrofit work.  &nbsp;  The more I dig, the more there is about energy. In the attachment from this email:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28725  There is an attached plan for the “diesel replacement” aka the Island Initiative. This is a quote from Ira Magaziner’s 8 page document about the Island Initiative, where he discusses the conflicts of interest and turning it into a long-term profit:  > Over time, we expect to develop a sustainable business model where we can secure funds from the payback on projects at closing that will sustain our participation. If it were not for the potential conflicts of interest associated with Secretary Clinton being Secretary of State, we could form partnerships with Governments from the outset which would give us potential returns from projects that we help launch. Once she is no longer Secretary of State, we could structure this work to cover our expenses or even to provide a considerable source of long term funding for the Clinton Foundation.  &nbsp;  They apparently also worked with the National Renewable Energy Lab in Haiti? I’m not sure if this is nefarious, but it is worth asking questions about. They seemed interested in helping with Islands Initiative too. The involvement of a US branch like that seems like something Hillary would have organized not Bill:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47744  >Another quick request. We've begun to work closely with NREL, the US Natl Renewable Energy Lab, on the island energy initiative. NREL is  also involved in a few things in Haiti, and they have a team going down there in a few weeks. They expressed interest in meeting with someone  from the Clinton Foundation or the President's team in order to get some background on energy, infrastructure, etc  &nbsp;  Furthermore, there is mention of the solar park work they have going on. Interestingly, the Gujurat solar park they helped established is not mentioned anywhere on the Clinton Foundation’s websites:  >> The Asian Development Bank is already partnering with us on solar park projects in India. They are keenly interested in working with us on diesel replacement opportunities. We are working with the Industrial Development Corporation and the Development Bank of South Africa on solar projects in South Africa and they both have mandates to go to other parts of Southern Africa to do renewable projects. The World Bank has a fund for projects like these.  &nbsp;   I wonder why they don't want it mentioned...  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46743   > President Clinton may want to know about this. It is an article in the London Times about the launch of the Gujarat solar park. The book put out by the Gujarat Government as well as this and other articles acknowledge our role.   &nbsp;  **FINALLY THE 2015 REACTIONS WHEN PRESS STARTS TO GET A WHIFF OF SOMETHING FOUL**  Example 1:   https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46014    >I’m sensitive to that (which is why I’m asking) but those CHAI Stats are on nearly every public listing of CF accomplishment. I’m want to make people think twice about calls for dropping grants to CF or return the money and the HIV/AIDS work hits home in a way that other stats don’t. Plus it’s international work. **I’m concerned about saying we used money to fund healthy schools (because we didn’t use the funding for that)**   They are discussing using CHAI's good deeds to deflect allegations about foreign conflicts of interest still being allowed to donate.  &nbsp;  Example 2:   Robby Mook doesn't think the CHAI line is going to cover it. You can feel his angst through this email:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46877  >Should we do another convo w Maura about really beefing up their efforts? **Still feels like their plan to push accomplishments is thin. Or am I just being anxious**?  &nbsp;  Example 3:   https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46045   > **I'm hoping someone is keeping tabs on Doug Band. Quote in here is from someone who worked in Clinton Foundation.**   **THEY FIRST IMPLICATE ERIC BRAVERMAN, WHO IS EITHER MISSING OR IN FBI CUSTODY RIGHT NOW**  &nbsp;  And finally, we have the foreign governments who have donated to the foundation for no expressed purpose…    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/45288   >So virtually all of these donations were to the endowment and were not for specific projects, correct? And are there examples of projects that are currently supported/funded through the endowment, or is the Foundation just building the endowment at this point (no disbursements)?  The reply to the question:  > **Qatar was for CGI . The only governments that donated to the endowment were: Saudi Arabia, Oman, and UAE**  &nbsp;  Same email:  >Sorry to be clear – foundation stops -- means stop taking foreign gov’t money. Is that possible? **If not we’re going to be very vulnerable on that throughout and I think our opponents and some on our side will say at is unseemly for a potential U.S. President taking money from foreign governments for her private foundation.**  &nbsp;   **PLEASE TWEET/EMAIL/POST THIS TO GET EXPOSURE. WE NEED THE MEDIA AND PEOPLE IN CHARGE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THIS AND GET THE FULL STORY**    Here is a PDF version of this guide for sharing: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByFWjHedOlCqQ2xWSEtwWGpBd3M/view?usp=sharing<'|'>

I couldn't find anything that looked anything like a traditional brigade, but that is probably because of the popularity of those mods; they are so popular that their comments usually have so many upvotes that if there is a comment that looks completely untouched, that is probably because a brigade countered the enormous number of upvotes it had before. Even if it does not look like you are brigading, you still might be.  -  ____________  -  # Do not post about censorship on /r/ politics on this subreddit.

<'|'>TRUMP JUST SIGNED THE FIVE YEAR BAN ON LOBBYING THE SWAMP IS BEING DRAINED<'|'>16474<'|'>5qq6hi<'|'>https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qq6hi/trump_just_signed_the_five_year_ban_on_lobbying/<'|'>1186<'|'>14856406800<'|'>Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csZNKadILk0  Edit: All of you CTR shills are back in full force I see. "H-he's not draining the swamp, look at his cabinet! Checkmate Drumpfkins!"  Bruh, this ban was on his own cabinet. If he wasn't following through and he was controlled by lobbyists, then he wouldn't be doing everything he is doing in seven fucking days. He wouldn't be getting wall-to-wall coverage as a illegitimate President and the coverage would be completely different. And more importantly, you CTR shills wouldn't be here doing everything you can to delegitimatize him. GTFO.  EDIT 2: Alright, I am getting a lot of comments about the title. Didn't mean for it to sound like he outright banned lobbying. I worded it that way because I knew my fellow The_Donald members understood what it meant, didn't think it'd reach the front page.<'|'>
